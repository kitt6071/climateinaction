Avian Mortality at Oil Pits in the United States: A Review of the Problem and Efforts for Its Solution,"Oil production operations produce waste fluids that may be stored in pits, open tanks, and other sites accessible to wildlife. Birds visit these fluid-filled pits and tanks (""oil pits""), which often resemble water sources, and may become trapped and die. The US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) has a program to reduce these impacts by locating problem pits, documenting mortality of protected wildlife species, and seeking cleanup or corrective action at problem pits with the help of state and federal agencies regulating the oil industry. Species identification and verification of protected status for birds recovered from oil pits are performed at the USFWS National Fish and Wildlife Forensics Laboratory. From 1992 to 2005, a minimum of 2060 individual birds were identified from remains recovered from oil pits, representing 172 species from 44 families. The taxonomic and ecological diversity of these birds indicates that oil pits pose a threat to virtually all species of birds that encounter them. Ninety-two percent of identified bird remains belonged to protected species. Most remains identified at the Forensics Laboratory were from passerines, particularly ground-foraging species. Based on Forensics Laboratory and USFWS field data, oil pits currently cause the deaths of 500,000-1 million birds per year. Although law enforcement and industry efforts have produced genuine progress on this issue, oil pits remain a significant source of mortality for birds in the United States.",2006,10.1007/s00267-005-0201-7
"Hybridization between the Mallard and native dabbling ducks: causes, consequences and management.","Waterbirds are currently facing various threats throughout the world. One threat that is often overlooked is hybridization with introduced species. This threatening process is especially significant for dabbling ducks (Genus Anas). The Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) has been introduced to various parts of the world and now hybridizes and threatens numerous Anas species. In this paper, we review hybridization between Mallards and dabbling ducks with a specific emphasis on threats to the Pacific Black Duck (A. superciliosa). We then present an overview of the potential mechanisms of hybridization and discuss monitoring techniques. We conclude by proposing management strategies and speculating on the future of native dabbling duck species.",2014,10.1071/PC140041
Concerns regarding the scientific evidence informing impact risk assessment and management recommendations for invasive birds,"Invasive species can be a major threat to biodiversity and economy. Given the large number of introduced invasive species and the limited resources available, a rigorous assessment of the potential impact of these species is of vital importance for prioritizing management programs. Often, general scoring systems in which certain criteria are used to assess the impact of an invader along several impact categories are applied to obtain a ranking of troublesome invaders. Likewise, Kumschick and Nentwig (2010) provided a first categorization of invasive bird impacts in Europe, and argued that several invasive birds should be eradicated because of the threat they pose to biodiversity.
This is surprising, as recent reviews suggest that there is little evidence that invasive birds strongly impact biodiversity. We therefore re-evaluated this risk assessment. We found that in the majority of cases, the evidence presented to support impact claims is weak, as they are generally not based on direct scientific research but on often anecdotal observations relating to small areas only. Moreover, even if all claims would materialize, this does not necessarily justify a call for eradication. Previous experiences with eradications have learnt that a feasibility study, encompassing all aspects of biological invasions (including public opinion and possible benefits of the invader) is critical for the achievement of any strategy against invasive species. This is essential, as ill-conceived calls for eradication could result in a public backlash, causing funding agencies and managers to shy away from the problems posed by invasive species.",2011,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2011.05.001
Assessing the risks of introduced chickens and their pathogens to native birds in the Galápagos Archipelago,"Poultry production is an important economic activity on inhabited islands of the Galápagos archipelago. There has been a recent surge in both small-scale backyard chickens and larger scale broiler production associated with growth in the human population and the tourist industry. With increased poultry production, concerns have been expressed about the increasing risk of transfer of disease from chickens to native Galápagos bird species that may have little resistance to introduced pathogens [Wikelski, M., Foufopoulos, J., Vargas, H., Snell, H., 2004. Galápagos birds and diseases: invasive pathogens as threats for island species. Ecology and Society 9(5). Available from: URL:http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol9/iss1/art5]. This study evaluates risks posed by chicken disease to endemic and native Galápagos bird species, based on empirical evidence of pathogens present in chickens on the islands and a literature review of effects of these pathogens in wild species. Pathogens identified in domestic chicken populations of immediate avian conservation concern are Newcastle disease, Mycoplasma gallisepticum, and the proventricular parasite Dispharynx sp. Newcastle disease (avian paramyxovirus-1) poses an imminent threat to Galápagos penguins (Spheniscus mendiculus), flightless cormorants (Phalacrocorax harrisi), and lava gulls (Larus fuliginosus), species with very small population sizes (less than 1500 animals each). Additionally, litter from broiler farms could affect ecological processes in local ecosystems. Improved poultry biosecurity measures are urgently needed on the Galápagos Islands for avian disease management, yet developing these strategies presents political, social, and economic challenges.",2005,10.1016/j.biocon.2005.06.025
Past and present status and conservation of the seabirds breeding in the Azores Archipelago,"The breeding seabirds of the Azores comprise five species of Procellariiformes, four Charadriiformes and one Pelecaniform. This paper reviews their past and present status, ecology and conservation. Historical population trends inferred from 16th and 17th century chronicles indicate dramatic declines for most species. While the main islands were important breeding places in the past, most seabird populations are now restricted to small islets. Intra- and inter-specific competition for nest sites is noteworthy among burrowing Procellariiformes and shortage of optimal breeding habitat seems important in limiting their populations. The chick-rearing periods of Procellariiformes with similar ecological niche do not overlap, suggesting that segregation related to partitioning of food resources or breeding habitat may be operating. Current threats to the Azores seabirds are diverse and may differentially affect the various species. They range from predation by introduced mammals, human disturbance and exploitation, habitat loss due to invasive alien plants and overgrazing by rabbits, and, potentially, competition with fisheries. Although the importance of the Azores seabird fauna was recognised in recent inventories, accurate population estimates are lacking and many potential breeding areas need surveying. For effective conservation much direct action is needed, including management plans for virtually all sites and wardening at the most important sites.",1996,https://doi.org/10.1016/S0006-3207(96)00037-7
Meta-analysis of avian and small-mammal response to fire severity and fire surrogate treatments in U.S. fire-prone forests,"Management in fire-prone ecosystems relies widely upon application of prescribed fire and/or fire surrogate (e.g., forest thinning) treatments to maintain biodiversity and ecosystem function. Recently, published literature examining wildlife response to fire and fire management has increased rapidly. However, none of this literature has been synthesized quantitatively, precluding assessment of consistent patterns of wildlife response among treatment types. Using meta-analysis, we examined the scientific literature on vertebrate demographic responses to burn severity (low/moderate, high), fire surrogates (forest thinning), and fire and fire surrogate combined treatments in the most extensively studied fire-prone, forested biome (forests of the United States). Effect sizes (magnitude of response) and their 95% confidence limits (response consistency) were estimated for each species-by-treatment combination with two or more observations. We found 41 studies of 119 bird and 17 small-mammal species that examined short-term responses (< or =4 years) to thinning, low/moderate- and high-severity fire, and thinning plus prescribed fire; data on other taxa and at longer time scales were too sparse to permit quantitative assessment. At the stand scale (<50 ha), thinning and low/moderate-severity fire demonstrated similar response patterns in these forests. Combined thinning plus prescribed fire produced a higher percentage of positive responses. High-severity fire provoked stronger responses, with a majority of species possessing higher or lower effect sizes relative to fires of lower severity. In the short term and at fine spatial scales, fire surrogate forest-thinning treatments appear to effectively mimic low/moderate-severity fire, whereas low/moderate-severity fire is not a substitute for high-severity fire. The varied response of taxa to each of the four conditions considered makes it clear that the full range of fire-based disturbances (or their surrogates) is necessary to maintain a full complement of vertebrate species, including fire-sensitive taxa. This is especially true for high-severity fire, where positive responses from many avian taxa suggest that this disturbance (either as wildfire or prescribed fire) should be included in management plans where it is consistent with historic fire regimes and where maintenance of regional vertebrate biodiversity is a goal.",2012,10.1890/12-0009.1
A review of the impacts of nature based recreation on birds,"Nature based recreation such as wildlife viewing, hiking, running, cycling, canoeing, horse riding and dog walking can have negative environmental effects. A review of the recreation ecology literature published in English language academic journals identified 69 papers from 1978 to 2010 that examined the effect of these activities on birds. Sixty-one of the papers (88%) found negative impacts, including changes in bird physiology (all 11 papers), immediate behaviour (37 out of 41 papers), as well as changes in abundance (28 out of 33 papers) and reproductive success (28 out of 33 papers). Previous studies are concentrated in a few countries (United States, England, Argentina and New Zealand), mostly in cool temperate or temperate climatic zones, often in shoreline or wetland habitats, and mostly on insectivore, carnivore and crustaceovore/molluscivore foraging guilds. There is limited research in some regions with both high bird diversity and nature based recreation such as mainland Australia, Central America, Asia, and Africa, and for popular activities such as mountain bike riding and horse riding. It is clear, however, that non-motorised nature based recreation has negative impacts on a diversity of birds from a range of habitats in different climatic zones and regions of the world.",2011,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2011.05.005
Inter-specific variation in avian responses to human disturbance,"Increasing urbanization and recreational activities around and within biodiversity hotspots require an understanding of how to reduce the impacts of human disturbance on more than a single species; however, we lack a general framework to study multiple species. One approach is to expand on knowledge about the theory of anti-predator behaviour to understand and predict how different species might respond to humans.

2
We reviewed the literature and found that only 21% of studies that used a behavioural approach to study human disturbance focused on multiple species. These studies identified a number of potential predictive variables.

3
We developed a simulation model that investigates interspecific variation in different parameters of disturbance with variation in human visitation. We found that fitness-related responses, such as the quantity of food consumed by a species, are relatively sensitive to the distance at which animals detect humans, the frequency of disturbance by humans and the interaction of these factors, but are less sensitive to other characteristics.

4
We examined avian alert distance (the distance animals first orientated to an approaching threat, a proxy for detection distance) across 150 species, controlling for phylogenetic effects. We found that larger species had greater alert distances than smaller species, which could increase local spatial and temporal limitations on suitable habitat with increasing human visitation.

5
Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that body size could be a potential predictor of responses to human disturbance across species, and could be used by managers to make conservation decisions regarding levels of human visitation to a protected site. We suggest that three things are essential to develop predictive models of how different species will respond to human disturbance. First, multiple indicators of disturbance should be studied to select those with lower intraspecific variation for a given study system. Secondly, the species-specific nature of responses should be identified. Thirdly, life history, natural history and other correlates with these species-specific responses must be assessed.",2005,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2005.01071.x
One Hundred Fifty Years of Change in Forest Bird Breeding Habitat: Estimates of Species Distributions,"Evaluating bird population trends requires baseline data. In North America the earliest population data available are those from the late 1960s. Forest conditions in the northern Great Lake states (U.S.A.), however, have undergone succession since the region was originally cut over around the turn of the twentieth century, and it is expected that bird populations have undergone concomitant change. We propose pre-Euro-American settlement as an alternative baseline for assessing changes in bird populations. We evaluated the amount, quality, and distribution of breeding bird habitat during the mid-1800s and early 1990s for three forest birds: the Pine Warbler (Dendroica pinus), Blackburnian Warbler (D. fusca), and Black-throated Green Warbler (D. virens). We constructed models of bird and habitat relationships based on literature review and regional data sets of bird abundance and applied these models to widely available vegetation data. Original public-land survey records represented historical habitat conditions, and a combination of forest inventory and national land-cover data represented current conditions. We assessed model robustness by comparing current habitat distribution to actual breeding bird locations from the Wisconsin Breeding Bird Atlas. The model showed little change in the overall amount of Pine Warbler habitat, whereas both the Blackburnian Warber and the Black-throated Green Warbler have experienced substantial habitat losses. For the species we examined, habitat quality has degraded since presettlement and the spatial distribution of habitat shifted among ecoregions, with range expansion accompanying forest incursion into previously open habitats or the replacement of native forests with pine plantations. Sources of habitat loss and degradation include loss of conifers and loss of large trees. Using widely available data sources in a habitat suitability model framework, our method provides a long-term analysis of change in bird habitat and a presettlement baseline for assessing current conservation priority.",2005,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2005.00254.x
"Conservation status of mammals and birds in southwestern Australian forests. II. Are there unstudied, indirect or long-term links between forestry practices and species decline and extinction?","There is little evidence in the literature for past or current negative impacts of forestry practices on the mammals and birds of the south-west forests of Western Australia, although there are few relevant, detailed studies. For the conclusion of no major negative impact of forestry practices to be accepted, it must be shown that there are no indirect connections between forestry practices and established causes of fauna decline and that it is unlikely that forestry practices will have delayed impacts on the conservation status of mammals and birds. This paper reviews the literature relevant to these issues and concludes: (i) past forestry practices are linked to the changed fire regimes implicated in the decline of several species, indirectly connecting forestry practices with an established cause of fauna decline, (ii) there are plausible links between forestry and long-term causes of fauna decline that have not been investigated thoroughly. However, these findings need not mean that a native timber industry is incompatible with conservation in the south-west forests. Rather, they highlight the need for mediation between parties in the forest management debate, perhaps using some of the approaches developed recently in eastern Australia and North America. Concurrently, research effort could be directed towards determining the effectiveness of management initiatives already in place to ameliorate forestry impacts, while identifying actions successful elsewhere and setting research priorities to enable their effective implementation in the south-west.

Forest managers, past and present, have good reason to be proud of their efforts. Even during earlier eras, when the focus of forest management was largely on timber supply, the need to ensure successful regeneration after logging has acted to conserve the whole jarrah and karri forest ecosystem. Abbott and Christensen (1994).

The challenges posed by old growth eucalypt forest management in Australia are unique and by virtue of historical events, lie with our generation. To our advantage is an appreciation of what reforms are required, the availability of adequate knowledge and technology, and an understanding of what is at stake. A move towards ecologically sustainable forest use in Australia's remaining eucalypt forests requires a combination of initiatives including an enhanced conservation reserve network, and markedly enhanced protective measures in unreserved forest ecosystems, irrespective of land tenure. Significant reductions in logging quotas and.",1998,10.1071/PC980315
"Pollution, habitat loss, fishing, and climate change as critical threats to penguins","Cumulative human impacts across the world's oceans are considerable. We therefore examined a single model taxonomic group, the penguins (Spheniscidae), to explore how marine species and communities might be at risk of decline or extinction in the southern hemisphere. We sought to determine the most important threats to penguins and to suggest means to mitigate these threats. Our review has relevance to other taxonomic groups in the southern hemisphere and in northern latitudes, where human impacts are greater. Our review was based on an expert assessment and literature review of all 18 penguin species; 49 scientists contributed to the process. For each penguin species, we considered their range and distribution, population trends, and main anthropogenic threats over the past approximately 250 years. These threats were harvesting adults for oil, skin, and feathers and as bait for crab and rock lobster fisheries; harvesting of eggs; terrestrial habitat degradation; marine pollution; fisheries bycatch and resource competition; environmental variability and climate change; and toxic algal poisoning and disease. Habitat loss, pollution, and fishing, all factors humans can readily mitigate, remain the primary threats for penguin species. Their future resilience to further climate change impacts will almost certainly depend on addressing current threats to existing habitat degradation on land and at sea. We suggest protection of breeding habitat, linked to the designation of appropriately scaled marine reserves, including in the High Seas, will be critical for the future conservation of penguins. However, large-scale conservation zones are not always practical or politically feasible and other ecosystem-based management methods that include spatial zoning, bycatch mitigation, and robust harvest control must be developed to maintain marine biodiversity and ensure that ecosystem functioning is maintained across a variety of scales.",2014,https://doi.org/10.1111/cobi.12349
Harvest and dynamics of duck populations,"The role of harvest in the dynamics of waterfowl populations continues to be debated among scientists and managers. Our perception is that interested members of the public and some managers believe that harvest influences North American duck populations based on calls for more conservative harvest regulations. A recent review of harvest and population dynamics of North American mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) populations (Pöysä et al. 2004) reached similar conclusions. Because of the importance of this issue, we reviewed the evidence for an impact of harvest on duck populations. Our understanding of the effects of harvest is limited because harvest effects are typically confounded with those of population density; regulations are typically most liberal when populations are greatest. This problem also exists in the current Adaptive Harvest Management Program (Conn and Kendall 2004). Consequently, even where harvest appears additive to other mortality, this may be an artifact of ignoring effects of population density. Overall, we found no compelling evidence for strong additive effects of harvest on survival in duck populations that could not be explained by other factors. © 2012 The Wildlife Society.",2012,https://doi.org/10.1002/jwmg.370
Poisoning from lead gunshot: still a threat to wild waterbirds in Britain,"Lead is a highly toxic metal known to be an important cause of morbidity and mortality in waterbirds and terrestrial birds worldwide. The risk to birds of poisoning from lead has resulted in the introduction of legislation in many countries, such as UK restrictions on the use of lead in angling weights and lead gunshot. In this study, we examined data on current and historical trends in lead poisoning in British waterbirds and related these to the introduction of legislation restricting the use of lead. Our results indicate that lead poisoning has continued to affect a wide range of British waterbirds long after legal restrictions were introduced. Elevated levels of lead (i.e. > 20.0 mu g/dL) were found in the blood of 34 % (n = 285) of waterbirds tested at four sites in Britain during the 2010/2011 winter and accounted for the deaths of at least 10.6 % (n = 2,365) of waterbirds recovered across Britain between 1971 and 2010 and 8.1 % (n = 1,051) between 2000 and 2010, with lead gunshot being the most likely source of poisoning. The proportion of birds dying from lead poisoning in England did not vary significantly after the introduction of legislation, accounting for 13.7 % of non-infectious causes of death between 1971 and 1987 (n = 204), 20.8 % (n = 360) between 1988 and 1999 and 11.8 % (n = 423) between 2000 and 2010, despite a significant change in lead-related mortality in mute swans found during the same time period, 25 % (n = 12) between 1971 and 1987, 4.6 % (n = 65) between 1988 and 1999 and 2 % (n = 100) between 2000 and 2010. Existing legislation needs review and extension to ensure the delivery of international commitments and a broad-scale transition to the use of non-toxic shot and angling materials in all environments.",2012,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10344-012-0666-7
Global population collapse in a superabundant migratory bird and illegal trapping in China,"Persecution and overexploitation by humans are major causes of species extinctions. Rare species, often confined to small geographic ranges, are usually at highest risk, whereas extinctions of superabundant species with very large ranges are rare. The Yellow-breasted Bunting (Emberiza aureola) used to be one of the most abundant songbirds of the Palearctic, with a very large breeding range stretching from Scandinavia to the Russian Far East. Anecdotal information about rapid population declines across the range caused concern about unsustainable trapping along the species' migration routes. We conducted a literature review and used long-term monitoring data from across the species' range to model population trend and geographical patterns of extinction. The population declined by 84.3-94.7% between 1980 and 2013, and the species' range contracted by 5000 km. Quantitative evidence from police raids suggested rampant illegal trapping of the species along its East Asian flyway in China. A population model simulating an initial harvest level of 2% of the population, and an annual increase of 0.2% during the monitoring period produced a population trajectory that matched the observed decline. We suggest that trapping strongly contributed to the decline because the consumption of Yellow-breasted Bunting and other songbirds has increased as a result of economic growth and prosperity in East Asia. The magnitude and speed of the decline is unprecedented among birds with a comparable range size, with the exception of the Passenger Pigeon (Ectopistes migratorius), which went extinct in 1914 due to industrial-scale hunting. Our results demonstrate the urgent need for an improved monitoring of common and widespread species' populations, and consumption levels throughout East Asia.",2015, 10.1111/cobi.12537
A review of lead poisoning from ammunition sources in terrestrial birds,"Poisoning from lead shot in waterbirds has been well documented globally and, in some countries, legislation exists to combat lead toxicosis at wetlands and/or in waterbirds. However, poisoning of terrestrial species such as raptors and upland game birds, while of potential conservation concern, remains largely to be addressed. For several species, shot are not the only ammunition source of lead, as bullet fragments can be ingested from hunter-killed animal carcasses and gut piles left in the field. This review collates the current knowledge of lead poisoning from ammunition in non-waterbirds. Fifty-nine terrestrial bird species have so far been documented to have ingested lead or suffered lead poisoning from ammunition sources, including nine Globally Threatened or Near Threatened species. We discuss the conservation significance of continued lead use, and detail measures needed to combat lead poisoning.",2006,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2006.02.018
Managing Birds and Controlling Aircraft in the Kennedy Airport–Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge Complex: The Need for Hard Data and Soft Opinions,"During the 1980s, the exponential growth of laughing gull (Larus atricilla) colonies, from 15 to about 7600 nests in 1990, in the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge and a correlated increase in the bird-strike rate at nearby John F. Kennedy International Airport (New York City) led to a controversy between wildlife and airport managers over the elimination of the colonies. In this paper, we review data to evaluate if: (1) the colonies have increased the level of risk to the flying public; (2) on-colony population control would reduce the presence of gulls, and subsequently bird strikes, at the airport; and (3) all on-airport management alternatives have been adequately implemented. Since 1979, most (2987, 87%) of the 3444 bird strikes (number of aircraft struck) were actually bird carcasses found near runways (cause of death unknown but assumed to be bird strikes by definition). Of the 457 pilot-reported strikes (mean = 23 ± 6 aircraft/yr, N= 20 years), 78 (17%) involved laughing gulls. Since a gull-shooting program was initiated on airport property in 1991, over 50,000 adult laughing gulls have been killed and the number of reported bird strikes involving laughing gulls has declined from 6.9 ± 2.9 (1983–1990) to 2.6 ± 1.3 (1991–1998) aircraft/yr; nongull reported bird strikes, however, have more than doubled (6.4 ± 2.6, 1983–1990; 14.9 ± 5.1, 1991–1998). We found no evidence to indicate that on-colony management would yield a reduction of bird strikes at Kennedy Airport. Dietary and mark–recapture studies suggest that 60%–90% of the laughing gulls collected on-airport were either failed breeders and/or nonbreeding birds. We argue that the Jamaica Bay laughing gull colonies, the only ones in New York State, should not be managed at least until all on-airport management alternatives have been properly implemented and demonstrated to be ineffective at reducing bird strikes, including habitat alterations and increasing the capability of the bird control unit to eliminate bird flocks on-airport using nonlethal bird dispersal techniques. Because the gull-shooting program may be resulting in a nonsustainable regional population of laughing gulls (>30% decline), we also recommend that attempts be made to initiate an experimental colony elsewhere on Long Island to determine if colony relocation is a feasible management option.",2001,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s002670010219
The state of the art in raptor electrocution research: A global review,"We systematically reviewed the raptor electrocution literature to evaluate study designs and methods used in raptor electrocution research, mitigation, and monitoring, emphasizing original research published in English. Specifically, we wondered if three decades of effort to reduce raptor electrocutions has had positive effects. The majority of literature examined came from North America, western Europe, and South Africa. In spite of intensive and often sustained effort by industry and governments across three continents for 30 years, reductions in the incidence of electrocution have been demonstrated in only a few studies. Reliable rate estimates of electrocution mortality generally are unavailable, with some exceptions. Nearly half of 110 studies we analyzed in detail were retrospective reviews of historical mortality records, banding data, or results of necropsies on dead birds received at pathology and veterinary facilities. Among prospective studies, less than half used unbiased approaches to sampling and many did not provide enough detail to assess the sampling design used. At this time, few researchers can demonstrate the reliability of standardized retrofitting procedures or the effectiveness of monitoring techniques. Future progress in reducing raptor mortalities on power lines will benefit from properly designed studies that generate rate estimates of mortality, address biasing factors, and include predictions concerning risk and techniques to reduce risk that can be tested in the field or laboratory.",2007,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2006.09.015
Estimation of bird-vehicle collision mortality on U.S. roads,"Roads have numerous direct and indirect ecological impacts on wildlife. Vehicle collisions are a top impact of roads on birds, with tens of millions of birds thought to be killed each year in the United States. However, currently available mortality estimates are extrapolated from a single study. We reviewed the literature and used 20 mortality rates extracted from 13 studies to systematically quantify data-driven estimates of annual U.S. mortality from bird-vehicle collisions. We generated 4 separate estimates along with uncertainty using different subsets of data deemed to be rigorous enough to contribute relatively little bias to estimates. All of our estimates of vehicle mortality are higher than previous U.S. figures. When averaging across model iterations, we estimated that between 89 and 340 million birds die annually from vehicle collisions on U.S. roads. Sensitivity analyses indicated that uncertainty about survey-related biases (scavenger removal and searcher detection of carcasses) contributes the greatest amount of uncertainty to our mortality estimates. Future studies should account for these biases to provide more accurate local estimates of mortality rates and to inform more precise national mortality estimates. We found relatively little information available to quantify regional, seasonal, and taxonomic patterns of vehicle collision risk, and substantial uncertainty remains about whether collisions contribute to large-scale impacts on bird populations. Nonetheless, the large magnitude of bird mortality caused by vehicle collisions combined with evidence that collisions can contribute to local population declines for some species highlights the need for implementation of conservation and management actions to reduce this mortality.

Effects of road networks on bird populations,"One potential contributor to the worldwide decline of bird populations is the increasing prevalence of roads, which have several negative effects on birds and other vertebrates. We synthesized the results of studies and reviews that explore the effects of roads on birds with an emphasis on paved roads. The well-known direct effects of roads on birds include habitat loss and fragmentation, vehicle-caused mortality, pollution, and poisoning. Nevertheless, indirect effects may exert a greater influence on bird populations. These effects include noise, artificial light, barriers to movement, and edges associated with roads. Moreover, indirect and direct effects may act synergistically to cause decreases in population density and species richness. Of the many effects of roads, it appears that road mortality and traffic noise may have the most substantial effects on birds relative to other effects and taxonomic groups. Potential measures for mitigating the detrimental effects of roads include noise-reduction strategies and changes to roadway lighting and vegetation and traffic flow. Road networks and traffic volumes are projected to increase in many countries around the world. Increasing habitat loss and fragmentation and predicted species distribution shifts due to climate change are likely to compound the overall effects of roads on birds.",2011,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2010.01635.x
Potential Impacts of Highway Median Barriers on Wildlife: State of the Practice and Gap Analysis,Median barriers separate lanes of traffic moving in opposite directions on multilane highways. Such traffic safety devices can reduce head-on collisions but also have the potential to reduce landscape permeability by impeding wildlife movements across highways. Median barriers may also increase the risk of wildlife-vehicle collisions if an animal becomes trapped or confused amid barriers searching for a place to cross. A 2002 Transportation Research Board report highlighted the need to better understand the potential impacts of highway median barriers on wildlife. This lack of information can cause significant project delays and increase transportation project costs. This study represents the first attempt in North America to bring together information about highway median and roadside barriers and wildlife and provide preliminary guidelines to balance the needs of motorist safety and wildlife movements.,2013,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-013-0155-0
Estimates of Avian Mortality Attributed to Vehicle Collisions in Canada,"Although mortality of birds from collisions with vehicles is estimated to be in the millions in the USA, Europe, and the UK, to date, no estimates exist for Canada. To address this, we calculated an estimate of annual avian mortality attributed to vehicular collisions during the breeding and fledging season, in Canadian ecozones, by applying North American literature values for avian mortality to Canadian road networks. Because owls are particularly susceptible to collisions with vehicles, we also estimated the number of roadkilled Barn owls (Tyto alba) in its last remaining range within Canada. (This species is on the IUCN red list and is also listed federally as threatened; Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada 2010, International Union for the Conservation of Nature 2012). Through seven Canadian studies in existence, 80 species and 2,834 specimens have been found dead on roads representing species from 14 orders of birds. On Canadian 1 and 2-lane paved roads outside of major urban centers, the unadjusted number of bird mortalities/yr during an estimated 4-mo (122-d) breeding and fledging season for most birds in Canada was 4,650,137 on roads traversing through deciduous, coniferous, cropland, wetlands and nonagricultural landscapes with less than 10% treed area. On average, this represents 1,167 birds killed/100 km in Canada. Adjusted for scavenging, this estimate was 13,810,906 (3,462 dead birds/100 km). For barn owls, the unadjusted number of birds killed annually on 4-lane roads during the breeding and fledging season, within the species geographic range in southern British Columbia, was estimated as 244 owls and, when adjusted for scavenging and observer bias (3.6 factor), the total was 851 owls.",2013,http://dx.doi.org/10.5751/ACE-00604-080202
Poor evidence-base for assessment of windfarm impacts on birds,"Concerns about anthropogenic climate change have resulted in promotion of renewable energy sources, especially wind energy. A concern raised against widespread windfarm development is that it may negatively impact bird populations as a result of bird collision with turbines, habitat loss and disturbance. Using systematic review methodology bird abundance data were synthesized from 19 globally-distributed windfarms using meta-analysis. The effects of bird taxon, turbine number, power, location, latitude, habitat type, size of area, time since operation, migratory status of the species and quality of evidence were analysed using meta-regression. Although the synthesized data suggest a significant negative impact of windfarms on bird abundance, there is considerable variation in the impact of individual windfarm sites on individual bird species, and it is unclear if the negative impact is a decline in population abundance or a decline in use owing to avoidance. Anseriformes experienced greater declines in abundance than other taxa, followed by Charadriiformes, Falconiformes and Accipitriformes, and Passeriformes. Time since windfarms commenced operation also had a significant impact on bird abundance, with longer operating times resulting in greater declines in abundance than short operating times. Other variables, including turbine number and turbine power either had very weak but statistically significant effects or did not have a significant effect on bird abundance. Windfarms may have significant biological impacts, especially over longer time scales, but the evidence-base is poor, with many studies being methodologically weak, and more long-term impact assessments are required. There is clear evidence that Anseriformes (wildfowl) and Charadriiformes (waders) experience declines in abundance, suggesting that a precautionary approach should be adopted to windfarm development near aggregations of these taxa in offshore and coastal locations. The impact of windfarm developments on bird populations must also be viewed in the context of the possible impact of climate change in the absence of windfarms.",2007,https://www.jstor.org/stable/44520995
Understanding bird collisions at wind farms: An updated review on the causes and possible mitigation strategies,"Bird mortality due to collisions with wind turbines is one of the major ecological concerns associated with wind farms. Data on the factors influencing collision risk and bird fatality are sparse and lack integration. This baseline information is critical to the development and implementation of effective mitigation measures and, therefore, is considered a priority research topic. Through an extensive literature review (we compiled 217 documents and include 111 in this paper), we identify and summarize the wide range of factors influencing bird collisions with wind turbines and the available mitigation strategies. Factors contributing to collision risk are grouped according to species characteristics (morphology, sensorial perception, phenology, behavior or abundance), site (landscape, flight paths, food availability and weather) and wind farm features (turbine type and configuration, and lighting). Bird collision risk results from complex interactions between these factors. Due to this complexity, no simple formula can be broadly applied in terms of mitigation strategies. The best mitigation option may involve a combination of more than one measure, adapted to the specificities of each site, wind farm and target species. Assessments during project development and turbine curtailment during operation have been presented as promising strategies in the literature, but need further investigation. Priority areas for future research are: (1) further development of the methodologies used to predict impacts when planning a new facility; (2) assessment of the effectiveness of existing minimization techniques; and (3) identification of new mitigation approaches.",2014,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2014.08.017
Estimates of bird collision mortality at wind facilities in the contiguous United States,"Wind energy has emerged as a promising alternative to fossil fuels, yet the impacts of wind facilities on wildlife remain unclear. Prior studies estimate between 10,000 and 573,000 fatal bird collisions with U.S. wind turbines annually; however, these studies do not differentiate between turbines with a monopole tower and those with a lattice tower, the former of which now comprise the vast majority of all U.S. wind turbines and the latter of which are largely being de-commissioned. We systematically derived an estimate of bird mortality for U.S. monopole turbines by applying inclusion criteria to compiled studies, identifying correlates of mortality, and utilizing a predictive model to estimate mortality along with uncertainty. Despite measures taken to increase analytical rigor, the studies we used may provide a non-random representation of all data; requiring industry reports to be made publicly available would improve understanding of wind energy impacts. Nonetheless, we estimate that between 140,000 and 328,000 (mean = 234,000) birds are killed annually by collisions with monopole turbines in the contiguous U.S. We found support for an increase in mortality with increasing turbine hub height and support for differing mortality rates among regions, with per turbine mortality lowest in the Great Plains. Evaluation of risks to birds is warranted prior to continuing a widespread shift to taller wind turbines. Regional patterns of collision risk, while not obviating the need for species-specific and local-scale assessments, may inform broad-scale decisions about wind facility siting.",2013,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2013.10.007
Bird interactions with offshore oil and gas platforms: Review of impacts and monitoring techniques,"Thousands of oil and gas platforms are currently operating in offshore waters globally, and this industry is expected to expand in coming decades. Although the potential environmental impacts of offshore oil and gas activities are widely recognized, there is limited understanding of their impacts on migratory and resident birds. A literature review identified 24 studies and reports of bird-platform interactions, most being qualitative and half having been peer-reviewed. The most frequently observed effect, for seabirds and landbirds, is attraction and sometimes collisions associated with lights and flares; episodic events have caused the deaths of hundreds or even thousands of birds. Though typically unpredictable, anecdotally, it is known that poor weather, such as fog, precipitation and low cloud cover, can exacerbate the effect of nocturnal attraction to lights, especially when coincidental with bird migrations. Other effects include provision of foraging and roosting opportunities, increased exposure to oil and hazardous environments, increased exposure to predators, or repulsion from feeding sites. Current approaches to monitoring birds at offshore platforms have focused on observer-based methods which can offer species-level bird identification, quantify seasonal patterns of relative abundance and distribution, and document avian mortality events and underlying factors. Observer-based monitoring is time-intensive, limited in spatial and temporal coverage, and suffers without clear protocols and when not conducted by trained, independent observers. These difficulties are exacerbated because deleterious bird-platform interaction is episodic and likely requires the coincidence of multiple factors (e.g., darkness, cloud, fog, rain conditions, occurrence of birds in vicinity). Collectively, these considerations suggest a need to implement supplemental systems for monitoring bird activities around offshore platforms. Instrument-based approaches, such as radar, cameras, acoustic recordings, and telemetry, hold promise for continuous monitoring. Recommendations are provided for a rigorous and comprehensive monitoring approach within an adaptive management framework.",2015,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2014.07.031
What is the impact of public access on the breeding success of ground-nesting and cliff-nesting birds?,"1. SUMMARY
1.1 Background
The Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (CRoW), which came into effect in 2005,
has created a statutory right of access to open country and registered common land in
England and Wales, extending the public's ability to enjoy the countryside by opening up
previously out-of-bounds areas. Scotland has similarly formalised access recently through
the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003. However, public access (both in the UK and
elsewhere) may have potentially deleterious impacts on habitats and associated flora and
fauna, including species of conservation concern. Within the CRoW Act there is
provision for the relevant authority to exclude or restrict access for the purpose of
conserving flora, fauna, geological or physiographical features of the land in question.
One particular concern and the focus of this systematic review, is the impact of human
disturbance on breeding success of ground-nesting and cliff-nesting birds. It was
considered that a systematic review would assist in evidence-based decision-making
regarding the restriction of access for conservation purposes.
1.2 Objectives
To assess the impact of public access on foot (including associated activities i.e. dog-
walking, picnicking, birdwatching, cross-country running, climbing, angling, mountain
biking and horse riding) on breeding success of ground-nesting and cliff-nesting birds.
1.3 Search strategy
Relevant studies were identified through searches of the following 12 electronic
databases: Agricola, Copac, Digital Dissertations Online, Directory of Open Access
Journals, English Nature‟s “Wildlink”, Europa, Index to Theses Online (1970-present),
ISI Web of Knowledge, JSTOR, Science Direct, Scirus and Scopus. Searches were
undertaken on conservation and statutory organisation websites: Agricultural
Development and Advisory Service (ADAS); Countryside Council for Wales (CCW);
Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD); Department of
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA); English Nature (EN) (now Natural
England); Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC); National Trust (NT); Royal
Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB); and Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH).
Bibliographies of traditional literature reviews and articles accepted into the systematic
review at the full text stage were examined for studies that had not yet been identified by
any other means. Subject experts were contacted.

1.4 Selection criteria
The criteria which studies had to meet for inclusion into the final stage of the systematic
review were:
1. Subject: breeding ground-nesting and cliff-nesting birds;
2. Intervention: human activities of walking (including dog-walking), picnicking,
birdwatching, crosscountry running, angling, climbing, mountain biking and horse
-riding;
3. Outcome: primary outcomes were changes in breeding abundance/density and
population effects (population size increase or decrease);
4. Type of study: any field/empirical study.
1.5 Main results
The searching of electronic databases and the internet produced 14,717 articles (Table 1).
After duplicates were removed, a total of 4,904 unique articles remained for assessment
at title and abstract stage, of which 173 were potentially relevant and required full text
assessment against the study inclusion criteria. Full text assessment yielded a total of 85
articles that were relevant for inclusion within the systematic review. Of these, 27 had
quantitative data (regarding the impact of public access and associated disturbance on
breeding success of ground-nesting and cliff-nesting birds) suitable for meta-analysis but
only 20 provided comparable data. A total of 42 independent data points presented data
regarding the subject area of which 38 could be used for meta-analysis. Four data points
were dropped due to heterogeneity in the scope of study, lack of comparators and lack of
estimates of variance.
Of the meta-analyses that could be undertaken sample sizes were severely limited,
primarily due to the lack of comparable quantitative data presented in studies. Those
undertaken indicate that hatching success and pre-fledgling survival are both significantly
reduced by human disturbance (although the latter outcome was skewed by findings of
one study and thus must be interpreted accordingly). There is no significant overall
effect on chick weight or fledgling success.
There is significant unexplained heterogeneity between studies and species for all the
outcomes examined. The period in the breeding cycle when disturbance occurs; the type
and intensity of disturbance; increased predation when attending adult birds are driven
from eggs and/or young; the habitat, and degree of habituation to people have all been
suggested as potential reasons for variability in avian response to disturbance. Small
sample sizes confounded attempts to derive quantitative relationships between these
explanatory covariates and effect.
Page 4

5
Taking into account findings of many other (mostly observational) studies subject to
review but which could not be incorporated into the meta-analysis, there is limited
evidence for reduced hatching and fledging success due to human disturbance on foot
(including with associated pet dogs) for some species.
Narrative synthesis shows that the few studies that have investigated the effects of human
disturbance on breeding densities of ground-nesting bird species, indicate that breeding
density (e.g. of common ringed plover Charadrius hiaticula, Eurasian golden plover
Pluvialis apricaria, dunlin Calidris alpina, European nightjar Caprimulgus europaeus
and woodlark Lullula arborea) is substantially reduced by recreational disturbances.
Such reduced breeding density, or lack of breeding success within otherwise potentially
suitable habitat (the latter as yet unproven), may be the main consequence of human
disturbance.
There is little quantitative evidence to draw any firm conclusions regarding cliff-nesting
species, but those few studies looking at impacts of human disturbance on breeding
success of cliff-nesting birds suggest a negative impact on breeding success.
1.6 Reviewers’ conclusions
Implications for conservation
Evidence from quantitative studies (i.e. that subject to meta-analysis) for the impact of
public access on breeding success is ambiguous (primarily due to small sample sizes).
Qualitative/observational evidence derived from many other studies suggests that human
disturbance through access on foot can be detrimental to the breeding success of ground-
nesting birds at all stages of the breeding cycle from territory establishment to fledging.
There are exceptions however, e.g. several species of penguins (Spheniscidae) and two
species of tern (Sternidae). The design and reporting of the qualitative/observational
studies leaves this evidence highly susceptible to bias.
A small number of mostly observational studies suggest that responses to a walker with a
dog tended to be stronger than a person approaching without one; displacement of
incubating or brooding birds led to increased predation risk from opportunistic predators,
especially larger gulls Larus spp. and corvids Corvus spp.
The level of impact is highly variable between species and dependent upon locality and
the disturbances involved. As such, proposed restrictions on access must take into
account sensitivity and vulnerability to disturbance on a species by species basis, and site
characteristics. There is insufficient evidence to draw any firm conclusions specifically
regarding cliff-nesting species, but that which is available suggests a negative impact of
human disturbance upon breeding success of a small number of species for which studies
have been undertaken.

Implications for further research
There is much scope for further investigation into the effects of human disturbance on the
breeding success of ground-nesting and cliff-nesting birds. Although there have been
many studies looking at the effects of disturbance, few have robust quantitative data
regarding impacts on breeding success and populations. Evidence given frequently stems
from ad hoc observations rather than from rigorous, structured field research. A number
of studies simply infer that a detrimental impact is presumed, or evidence presented is
anecdotal. Some lack suitable controls, whilst in others disturbance levels (or treatments)
are not well assessed or are poorly defined. Especially useful would be longer term
studies investigating the consequences of disturbance impacting at the population level,
of which to date very few ecologists have tackled. The role of recreational disturbance in
reducing breeding bird densities (and potential site-scale desertion) could usefully be
further addressed. It is evident that for some species the degree of habituation to people
may be an important factor governing breeding success; this could also therefore be a
topic of further research.",2010,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236035754_What_is_the_impact_of_public_access_on_the_breeding_success_of_ground-nesting_and_cliff-nesting_birds
"What are the impacts of human recreational activity on the distribution, nest-occupancy rates and reproductive success of breeding raptors?","Background
One of the most common topics in environmental impact assessment is the effects of human disturbance on bird species, and particularly on birds of prey. However, scientific information available on this topic has never been properly synthesized so that decisions taken by managers can be based on evidence rather than on personal experience or on individual pieces of information which may be inconsistent with the whole.

Objectives
To systematically collect and synthesize the available published and unpublished evidence in order to answer the question ‘what are the impacts of human recreational activities on nest-occupancy rates and reproductive success of breeding raptors?’

Search strategy
Seven electronic databases were searched using 19 sets of specific keywords. Unpublished information was sought by means of web-based search engines and by writing to individual experts and institutions involved in raptor study and protection.

Selection criteria
We included studies that fulfilled the following criteria:

Subject: breeding raptors (both diurnal and nocturnal)
Intervention: human recreational activities performed close to nesting sites during the breeding period.
Outcomes: changes in nesting-site location, nest-occupancy rate and breeding success parameters.
Types of study: any field in situ study carried out in any part of the world involving wild-breeding raptors, comparing occupied nests (treatment) with random points in unoccupied areas suitable for reproduction or comparing nest location and performance before and after human disturbance took place (BACI experiments).
Data collection and analysis
Agreement between two independent researchers was assessed and a high degree of accordance was found for study inclusion, suggesting a repeatable procedure. Data (all original statistics from which an effect size could be calculated) were extracted following an a priori data extraction protocol regarding subject, intervention and outcome. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed by means of the software Metawin 2.1 on twenty-four independent data points, consisting of means, standard deviations and sample sizes of both control and treatment. The overall data set was divided into subgroups and meta-analysis was performed for each subgroup individually to account for heterogeneity. We modelled causes of heterogeneity by means of the software and environment R, taking individual effect sizes as the response variable, species and nesting site (tree vs. cliff-nesting) as factors and body size as a covariate (both as a continuous variable and as a dichotomous one). Models were built both for Hedge’s d and the log response ratio (lnR), as effect size metrics. Model selection was carried out taking into account the loss of Kullback-Leibler information by means of information theoretic criteria linking classical likelihood theory with theoretical information criteria (Akaike Information Criterion and Akaike weights).

Main results
A total of 3887 articles were detected by our specific searches. The final number of articles considered for data extraction was 52. The only outcome that we could meta- analyze was the displacement distance of nests from roads, compared to random points in suitable areas for breeding. Although the literature also provided comparable information on other anthropic variables, such as distance to unpaved tracks, we decided to consider only one of these variables (roads) as surrogate of human access to the countryside. A total of 24 studies were found to provide comparable information on this outcome.

A modest statistically significant effect of the presence of paved roads (as a proxy of human accessibility to the countryside) on raptor nest location was found after performing a random-effects meta-analysis on 24 independent data points (Pooled effect size (lnR)=0.22 (Bootstrap 95%CI 0.036 to 0.423; back-transformed ln Response Ratio 1.28; 1.07-1.57 bootstrap 95% CI). The mean absolute magnitude of nest displacement from roads, compared to random control points, was 663.46±389.23m.

Species negatively affected by roads included Cooper’s hawk, Spanish Imperial Eagle, Cinereous Vulture, Booted eagle, Eagle owl, Common buzzard, Bald eagle, and Peregrine falcon, some of them endangered species. Species which showed a tendency to be positively affected by roads included: Peregrine falcon, Booted eagle and Common Buzzard. The fact that some species such as Booted eagles and Common buzzards are present in both categories suggests that distance to roads is, to some extent, a population-specific trait, rather than a species-specific trait.

When exploring heterogeneity by means of Generalized Linear Mixed Models two explicative variables were considered: size of the raptor (body length), and nature of nesting substrate (tree-nesting vs. cliff-nesting) in addition to species which was incorporated as a random variable to prevent pseudoreplication. The longest displacement distances to roads were shown by big raptors breeding on trees, a group including many threatened species such as Cinereous vulture and Spanish Imperial eagle. Mean distance for this group of species was 1375±922.4m. In fact, model selection by means of information theoretic criteria indicated the influence of body size and nesting substrate on effect size was similar, especially when using Hedges’ d as an effect size metric.

Conclusions
Implications for management / policy / conservation: In countries where forested areas are very fragmented, the fact that big and tree-nesting raptors tend to nest far from roads can be a serious handicap for reproduction. Big raptors commonly nesting on trees (e.g. Booted eagle) which are found nesting on cliffs eventually, might reflect local human disturbance if trees are not scarce. Similarly, typically cliff-nesting raptors found breeding on trees (e.g. Golden eagle) might indicate low local human disturbance, if cliff availability is not a limiting factor locally.

Implications for research: Further empirical work (BACI experiments) to quantify the effect of human recreational activities on breeding raptors needs to be carried out if conservation decisions are to be based on evidence. No substantive progress on knowledge accumulation regarding this topic has been detected in the last 30 years.",2008,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236035964_What_are_the_impacts_of_human_recreational_activity_on_the_distribution_nest-occupancy_rates_and_reproductive_success_of_breeding_raptors
Expert opinion as a tool for quantifying bird tolerance to human disturbance,"Human disturbance can have several adverse effects on wildlife and therefore is increasingly seen as a threat. A common resolution of problems associated with encroaching human activities is to separate them from sensitive wildlife areas by protective buffer zones or set-back distances within which human activity is restricted. The most common method to establish such protective regimes is to record empirically the distance at which animals show signs of disturbance to human activity. However, a literature review for 26 bird species revealed that in only six of these species were there empirical measures of disturbance distances when breeding, but buffer zones had been recommended or designated in all species, often in several instances. This inferred prescription of buffer zones despite a severe knowledge gap. As a research stopgap, for the 26 species, we surveyed over 1000 expert opinions which generated estimates of alert distance (AD) and flight initiation distance (FID) in response to an approaching human during incubation and chick-rearing. Surveyed opinions on FID were not statistically significantly different to empirical measures of FID. Opinions on AD were much greater than predictions based on body mass derived from a previous study, but other evidence inferred a problem with predictions rather than opinions. The slope of the relationship between opinions on AD and FID conformed to the ‘fixed-slope rule’ (i.e. FID = 0.44∗AD) for incubating birds, but was higher for chick-rearing birds. At both stages of the breeding cycle, however, FID was approximately half-AD, reflecting previous studies. The validation exercises therefore provided some encouragement that the expert opinion survey produced realistic results, but we recommend that their use should be temporary until more empirical measures of disturbance distances are gathered. We further recommend that existing monitoring schemes in which field surveyors routinely visit birds’ nests should incorporate protocols to measure disturbance distances to amass such information rapidly and in quantity.",2008,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2008.08.007
A review of the impacts of nature based recreation on birds,"Nature based recreation such as wildlife viewing, hiking, running, cycling, canoeing, horse riding and dog walking can have negative environmental effects. A review of the recreation ecology literature published in English language academic journals identified 69 papers from 1978 to 2010 that examined the effect of these activities on birds. Sixty-one of the papers (88%) found negative impacts, including changes in bird physiology (all 11 papers), immediate behaviour (37 out of 41 papers), as well as changes in abundance (28 out of 33 papers) and reproductive success (28 out of 33 papers). Previous studies are concentrated in a few countries (United States, England, Argentina and New Zealand), mostly in cool temperate or temperate climatic zones, often in shoreline or wetland habitats, and mostly on insectivore, carnivore and crustaceovore/molluscivore foraging guilds. There is limited research in some regions with both high bird diversity and nature based recreation such as mainland Australia, Central America, Asia, and Africa, and for popular activities such as mountain bike riding and horse riding. It is clear, however, that non-motorised nature based recreation has negative impacts on a diversity of birds from a range of habitats in different climatic zones and regions of the world.",2011,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2011.05.005
Impacts of birdwatching on human and avian communities,"Ecotourism can be a vehicle for community-based conservation if it is conducted with an emphasis on the well-being of local ecosystems and human communities.

Birdwatching tourism has a high potential to improve the financial and environmental well-being of local communities, educate locals about the value of biodiversity and create local and national incentives for successful protection and preservation of natural areas. However, there needs to be more research on the economical and environmental impacts of this hobby, birdwatching-related disturbance needs to be reduced, and much has to be done to increase the financial contribution of birdwatching to local communities.

Inter-specific variation in avian responses to human disturbance,"1
Increasing urbanization and recreational activities around and within biodiversity hotspots require an understanding of how to reduce the impacts of human disturbance on more than a single species; however, we lack a general framework to study multiple species. One approach is to expand on knowledge about the theory of anti-predator behaviour to understand and predict how different species might respond to humans.

2
We reviewed the literature and found that only 21% of studies that used a behavioural approach to study human disturbance focused on multiple species. These studies identified a number of potential predictive variables.

3
We developed a simulation model that investigates interspecific variation in different parameters of disturbance with variation in human visitation. We found that fitness-related responses, such as the quantity of food consumed by a species, are relatively sensitive to the distance at which animals detect humans, the frequency of disturbance by humans and the interaction of these factors, but are less sensitive to other characteristics.

4
We examined avian alert distance (the distance animals first orientated to an approaching threat, a proxy for detection distance) across 150 species, controlling for phylogenetic effects. We found that larger species had greater alert distances than smaller species, which could increase local spatial and temporal limitations on suitable habitat with increasing human visitation.

5
Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that body size could be a potential predictor of responses to human disturbance across species, and could be used by managers to make conservation decisions regarding levels of human visitation to a protected site. We suggest that three things are essential to develop predictive models of how different species will respond to human disturbance. First, multiple indicators of disturbance should be studied to select those with lower intraspecific variation for a given study system. Secondly, the species-specific nature of responses should be identified. Thirdly, life history, natural history and other correlates with these species-specific responses must be assessed.",2005,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2005.01071.x
REVIEW: Evidence of negative effects of anthropogenic structures on wildlife: a review of grouse survival and behaviour,"Anthropogenic structures such as those associated with energy development are a major threat to wildlife as a result of direct and indirect effects on populations. Species already imperilled as a result of habitat loss and alteration also may be the most threatened by rapidly increasing energy development, and these added pressures could lead to species extinctions and further declines in biodiversity.
Of particular concern are tetraonids (grouse spp.) which have life cycles that require large, intact habitats to persist. We searched the peer-reviewed literature to assess impacts of six anthropogenic structures (i.e. oil and gas, fences, wind turbines, buildings, roads and power lines) on grouse survival and displacement behaviour across four different time periods in a grouse life cycle (i.e. year around, lekking, nesting and brooding).
We used 5 studies that examined a total of 23 study–structure combinations to assess displacement behaviour in grouse and found an average effect of −1·40 (95% CI: −1·50, −1·31), indicating that anthropogenic structures displace grouse. Similarly, we used 9 studies examining a total of 17 study–structure combinations to assess survival and found an average effect of −1·11 (95% CI: −1·33, −0·88), indicating a negative effect of structures on grouse survival.
Oil and gas structures had the greatest negative effect on displacement behaviour (urn:x-wiley:00218901:media:jpe12331:jpe12331-math-0001 = −2·41, 95% CI: −3·28, −1·54), and of the periods of the life cycle examined, lek attendance was most affected (urn:x-wiley:00218901:media:jpe12331:jpe12331-math-0002 = −4·85, 95% CI: −6·39, −3·31).
Synthesis and applications. This data-driven synthesis reveals an overall negative effect of anthropogenic structures on grouse displacement behaviour and survival. Specifically, grouse were displaced and had lower survival in the presence of oil and gas structures and the presence of roads resulted in displacement behaviour. Too few studies existed to examine the specific effects of wind turbines and fences on displacement behaviour and the impact of wind turbines, fences, buildings and power lines on survival, which emphasizes the need for research assessing the influence of these structures on wildlife. Future management should focus on limiting the amount of oil and gas and road development in areas occupied by extant grouse populations, and if unavoidable, new infrastructure should be placed at low densities away from known lekking locations as leks appear sensitive to disturbance from anthropogenic structures.",2014,https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.12331
