Litter samples drawn from three adjacent forests of lodgepole pine, white spruce, and Engelmann spruce \u2013 subalpine fir, and from a small clearcut area, were allowed to decompose for 3 years at their sites of origin. The best predictors of mass loss were the initial concentrations of lignin and labile material in the litter. Adding N or P contents as a second term, rather than as a lignin to nutrient ratio, significantly improved mass loss predictions. There were abrupt limits for the influence of lignin (above 28%) and N (below C:N of 30:1); similar limits were observed for all predictors except labile content. None of these chemical parameters, nor a physical measure, particle diameter, were useful in predicting rates of decomposition of high-lignin, woody substrates. The relative importance of the various litter quality parameters in determining rates of mass loss in the clear-cut area was very similar to that in the forests, despite considerably more rapid decomposition in the clearcut.

    "text": "Context The role of disturbance and its exclusion is fundamental to the conservation of threatened species. Aims We used the habitat accommodation model as a framework to investigate the importance of forest disturbance for the endangered Hastings River mouse, Pseudomys oralis, focusing on timber harvesting. Methods Our study comprised two separate surveys. We resurveyed old survey sites (n = 24) where the species was originally recorded as either present (logging excluded) or absent (subsequently logged). A second survey targeted trapping in high-quality habitat stratified by different times since logging. Finally, we analysed a 15-year trapping dataset targeting P. oralis to assess associations with co-occurring species. Key results The resurvey of old sites resulted in 12 P. oralis individuals being trapped, compared with 46 individuals in original surveys. Substantial declines were observed over time in transects where logging was excluded (60\u201382% decline), whereas there was little change at transects where P. oralis was not previously trapped and that were subsequently logged. The second survey yielded 27 P. oralis captures at post-logging sites assessed as high quality. Occupancy was very high (\u03c8 = 0.93 \u00b1 0.21) in transects logged 7\u201315 years ago and was 60% less in transects where logging was excluded for 35\u201345 years (\u03c8 = 0.37 \u00b1 0.22), whereas occupancy in transects logged 2\u20136 years ago was intermediate. This pattern of higher occupancy in logged areas was mirrored for the mean number of P. oralis trapped per transect. Ordination of habitat data showed an association of P. oralis with heath, mat-rushes and logs, whereas rats (Rattus and Melomys) were associated with ferns and shrubs. Camera traps revealed low background levels of predator presence. A negative exponential relationship was found between probability of occupancy of P. oralis and rat abundance from a 15-year trapping dataset (44 275 trap-nights), suggesting that rats may compete with P. oralis. Conclusions Our results supported the habitat accommodation model and suggested that disturbance is likely to influence the persistence of P. oralis. However, an interaction between predation and loss of cover from high-frequency disturbance (fire or intense grazing) cannot be excluded as a key threat. Implications Disturbance should be incorporated into the management of some species. Adaptive monitoring is recommended to assess alternative management regimes.",

This paper argues for the modification of the behavioural model of \u2018\n              Homo economicus\n              \u2019 by explicitly allowing for cognitive limits and non\u2010reflective modes of behaviour in addition to situational utility\u2010maximizing behaviour. These modifications take into account actual difficulties in changing individual land\u2010use decisions. While it is possible to adjust behaviour by moral persuasion, consensus\u2010oriented round\u2010tables or planning processes, such approaches are unlikely to bring about effective changes in land\u2010use decisions without changing relative prices. This paper suggests ways to implement a special land\u2010use tax as a reform model for existing property taxes. Such a land\u2010use tax applies different rates according to ecological damage. Accordingly, surfaces covered by buildings will pay higher tax rates than free space. Conventional agriculture will pay more than forest areas, and nature reserve areas will be free of charge. Such a land\u2010use tax, designed as a revenue\u2010neutral alternative to Germany's property tax, could trigger modest changes in land\u2010use behaviour in the near future. A general reform of local fiscal relations could increase this effect in the long run. Copyright \u00a9 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

    "text": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>Many arid grasslands around the world are affected by woody plant encroachment and by the replacement of a relatively continuous grass cover with shrub patches bordered by bare soil. This shift in plant community composition is often abrupt in space and time, suggesting that it is likely sustained by positive feedbacks between vegetation and environmental conditions (e.g. resource availability) or disturbance regime (e.g. fire or freeze). These feedbacks amplify the effects of drivers of shrub encroachment, i.e. of conditions favouring a shift from grass to shrub dominance (e.g. overgrazing, climate change). Here, we review some major drivers and feedbacks and identify the basic stages in the transition from grassland to shrubland. We discuss some possible scenarios of interactions between drivers and feedbacks that could explain the transition from a stage to the next and the potential irreversibility of the shift from grass to shrub dominance. We introduce a simplistic modelling framework that can integrate the various drivers to explain the emergence of bistability for shrub\u2010encroached grassland systems. Published 2011.

Measured in terms of numbers of vehicles sold, Bluefin Robotics is the world's largest commercial manufacturer of autonomous underwater. Figures 1 through 5 show several of Bluefin's AUVs in action. This paper presents some of the field data that was taken with these AUVs. Specific data of the Bluefin 5000 is presented in detail. Both the sonar and the navigation data shows the success of Bluefin's \"small is beautiful\" design philosophy. Bluefin's current class of vehicles are the smallest survey systems in the commercial survey market. Current development efforts at Bluefin are pushing the envelope even further by fielding a new class of AUVs with a diameter of 12.75 inches. Modularity is crucial to this new design and it will allow the integration of a whole new class of survey sonars. Current developments in synthetic aperture sonars are particularly exiting and promise to revolutionize the way that data will be gathered in the not so distance future.

The BLUEFIN 5000 is specifically designed for wide-area high resolution surveys missions. As such, the vehicle's main payload is a high-resolution, multi-beam side-scan sonar, the Klein 5000. The BLUEFIN 5000's oceanographic payload sensors include CTD, fluorometer, and light-scattering sensors. The design of the BLUEFIN 5000 is modular, with all essential vehicle components (main electronics pressure vessel, computation, propulsion, navigation and attitude sensors) contained in the aft modular section of the vehicle. The forward modular section contains the Klein 5000 sidescan sonar, the CTD, the fluorometer, and the light-scattering sensor. The forward modular section also contains two redundant battery packs in separate battery housings. Spent battery packs are easily replaced by removing the BLUEFIN 5000's hemispherical nose-cone, sliding each cylindrical battery housing out of the vehicle, and then re-inserting charged batteries.

The Trott nearfield calibration array (NFCA) concept solves this problem by allowing the farfield radiation to be determined from measurements made close to the transducer. We describe here the development of a 5- to 50-kHz synthetic cylindrical NFCA that is suitable for measurement tanks as small as about 2.5 m in each dimension and that can be operated at hydrostatic pressures up to 6.8 MPa. The NFCA is synthesized using a single line of 48 piezoelectric ceramic hydrophone elements spaced 2.54-cm apart center-to-center and amplitude shaded in a special way. The transducer to be calibrated is driven electrically and rotated near the line about an axis parallel to the line. The response of the line is measured at equally spaced angular positions, thereby creating a virtual cylindrical array surrounding the transducer. We then obtain the azimuthal farfield pattern of the transducer by computer processing the angular responses together with a set of complex shading coefficients. We evaluated the line experimentally by calibrating a large piston transducer in a cylindrical measurement tank less than 2.5 m in diameter. The resulting computed farfield patterns are in excellent agreement with corresponding patterns obtained from direct farfield measurements made in a lake.</jats:p>",

It is recommended that C. mitis be recognized at the subspecific rank as C.\u00a0arbuscula subsp. mitis , and that subsp. squarrosa be included in subsp. beringiana . The apparent lack of correlation in C.\u00a0arbuscula between genetic variability in the mycobiont and observed morphological variation in the thallus is intriguing, and requires explanation. </jats:p>",

Complementary data from trawl (soft substratum) and trap (hard substratum) fisheries were analysed within a general linear modelling (GLM) framework to assess distribution, abundance and population structure of Chaceon macphersoni off eastern South Africa. Catch rates, mean size, maturation size and sex ratio were modelled relative to year, month, depth, latitude and gear effects. Trap and trawl analyses indicated higher abundance as depth increased up to 500\u2009m, and during the austral spring and summer. The mean size of crabs remained constant at all depths sampled, and sex ratios were skewed towards females. Females were smaller than males, and achieved maturity at a smaller size. A standardised index based on trawl data (1988\u20132010) showed a long-term decline in abundance, with some recovery after 2002, whereas the trap index showed recent local depletions on hard substrata. Using data from two gear types confirmed broad gradients in abundance, but also emphasised subtle trends, such as local depletions on hard substrata, that would not have been apparent from trawl data only.\n</jats:p>",

This paper emphasizes data gathered by APL-UW using a set of four upward-looking transducers (frequency 240 kHz), which simultaneously measured vertical profiles of acoustic volume scattering from bubbles from four locations.

The transport of bubbles via rip currents emerged as a key feature surf zone bubble environment. Images of volumetric backscattering strength versus time and depth reveal episodic events (by way of increased scattering level) which last O(100) s and can occur in intervals of O(10) min. Time lags for increased scattering at the four locations were consistent with a seaward flow of rip currents equal to \u223c0.25 m/s.

Two sites, 4\u2002km apart, were grazed with yearling beef cattle from 1987 to 1993. Forage yield differed among grass treatments in 4 of 5 years, but differences were inconsistent over time. Five-year mean forage yields and total livestock production were not significantly different among the four grasses. Mean annual forage yields ranged from 800 to 8170\u2002kg ha<jats:sup>\u22121</jats:sup> and were related to the amount of growing season (April\u2013August) precipitation. Carrying capacity ranged from 35 steer grazing days per hectare in 1992 to 176 in 1991. Grasses in the mixtures did have a significant effect on the grass\u2013alfalfa ratio and on ground cover. Alfalfa content was highest when grown with Altai wildrye and lowest when grown with Russian wildrye. Percentage of ground cover by the grass plus alfalfa increased from an average of 3.8% in 1987 to 16.1% at one site and 31.9% at the second site by 1993. Russian wildrye contained the least alfalfa and weeds after 7\u2002yr. Intermediate wheatgrass and Altai wildrye did not compete with invading weeds at one site, or with alfalfa at the other, and should not be recommended for spring\u2013summer pastures in semiarid regions.

Kicking\u2014shoving contests are used to establish microterritories 3\u20145 mm in length. The largest stem mothers usually win in competitive bouts. Small differences in body size (i.e., a 3.4% difference in prothorax widths) are more importantly associated with territorial interactions than with fecundity. Stem mothers that win the superior basal position of a leaf produce an average of 56% more progeny than stem mothers displaced to inferior distal positions. Differences in reproductive performance within a leaf result from microhabitat variation in leaf quality. A change of only a few millimetres in the position of the gall on the leaf blade affects aphid reproduction. Experimental removal of either member of a competing pair allows the remaining stem mother to cross the former territorial boundary and enlarge her own territory. The impact of competitive release on reproductive success is asymmetrical. The distal stem mother of a competing pair achieves an average 48.5% increase in number of progeny, whereas the basal stem mother achieves an 18.5% increase in number of progeny. Because both members of a competing pair suffer reduced success from competitive interactions, selection favors stem mothers that occupy leaves singly.

Similar data are reported for the recognition of words and whole sentences in three types of sentence: high predictability (HP) sentences, with both semantic and syntactic constraints; low predictability (LP) sentences, with primarily syntactic constraints; and zero predictability (ZP) sentences, with neither semantic nor syntactic constraints. The probability of recognition of speech units in context (pc) is shown to be related to the probability of recognition without context (pi) by the equation pc=1\u2212(1\u2212pi)k, where k is a constant. The factor k is interpreted as the amount by which the channels of statistically independent information are effectively multiplied when contextual constraints are added. Empirical values of k are approximately 1.3 and 2.7 for word and sentence context, respectively. In a second analysis, the probability of recognition of wholes (pw) is shown to be related to the probability of recognition of the constituent parts (pp) by the equation pw=pjp, where j represents the effective number of statistically independent parts within a whole. The empirically determined mean values of j for nonsense materials are not significantly different from the number of parts in a whole, as predicted by the underlying theory. In CVC words, the value of j is constant at approximately 2.5. In the four-word HP sentences, it falls from approximately 2.5 to approximately 1.6 as the inherent recognition probability for words falls from 100% to 0%, demonstrating an increasing tendency to perceive HP sentences either as wholes, or not at all, as S/N ratio deteriorates.</jats:p>",

Studies on the euryhaline killifish,  Fundulus heteroclitus , adapted to saltwater showed that acclimatization to 2\u00b0 C or \u22121.5\u00b0 C increased serum osmolality of sodium and chloride when compared with controls at 10\u00b0 C or 20\u00b0 C (ref. 9). These data were interpreted to mean that, as in other fish, osmoregulatory ability was less efficient in cold-acclimatized  F. heteroclitus . If this was so, then for fish adapted to freshwater the serum osmolality of sodium and chloride would be expected to decrease when the temperature was lowered. The preliminary data reported here demonstrate that this is the case.",

It was found thattemperature and humidity fluctuations also occurred during each stage. The evidence of this is the reconstructed micro-rhythm in the development of vegetation of each stage. The main features of vegetation composition were determined for four warm and five cold stages of nature development, and a pattern of vegetation changes was retraced during each stage. The dynamics of vegetation cover of the Prydonetska Plain, different parts of the Prydniprovska Lowland, the Prydniprovska Upland, the Near Black Sea Lowland, and the Podil\u2019ska Upland vegetation during the specified geological time was reconstructed. General and regional distinctions of the composition of vegetation cover were revealed, and the influence of the main climatic factors such as temperature and humidity on the character of its changes was retraced. The stages characterized by the warmest and wet climatic conditions and the most cold and dry ones were established. It was substantiated that the climatic conditions of the Sula period were less severe than in the subsequent stages of the fall of temperature. The existence of refugiums of thermophilic flora in the Sula period within separate regions of Ukraine was established. The existence of vegetation zonality was substantiated not only in warm stages, but also in cold periods of the Early Neopleistocene.</jats:p>",

The regulations are administratively complex and vary from state to state, but the general pattern of regulation follows that set by the comprehensive Federal regulation which began in 1937 with the passage of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act. Milk markets in most of the country, including the major producing regions, are regulated and controlled by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). As a result of both state and federal controls, virtually no markets are unregulated. The consequences of Federal regulation of milk markets have been studied intensively, notably by Kessel and more recently by Kwoka. Less is known about the form and effects of state regulation. In this paper we analyze the case of milk market regulation in North Carolina. Specifically, we (1) review the ongoing regulation and assess the market structure and conduct of market participants including regulators; (2) review and analyze the economic implications and legal developments in reconstituting milk; and (3) investigate the policy alternatives with the purpose of determining whether there are options which, if adopted, will generate more social gains than associated social losses.</jats:p>",

Photomodeling is an already tested interactive approach to produce a detailed and quick 3D model reconstruction. Photomodeling goes along with the creation of a rough surface over which oriented images can be back-projected in real time. Lastly the model can be enhanced checking the coincidence between the surface and the projected texture. The challenge of this research is to combine the advantages of two technologies already set up and used in many projects: spherical photogrammetry (Fangi, 2007,2008,2009,2010) and structure for motion (Photosynth web service and Bundler + CMVS2 + PMVS2). The input images are taken from the same points of view to form the set of panoramic photos paying attention to use well-suited projections: equirectangular for spherical photogrammetry and rectilinear for Photosynth web service. The performance of the spherical photogrammetry is already known in terms of its metric accuracy and acquisition quickness but time is required in the restitution step because of the manual homologous point recognition from different panoramas. In Photosynth instead the restitution is quick and automated: the provided point clouds are useful benchmarks to start with the model reconstruction even if lacking in details and scale. The proposed workflow needs of ad-hoc tools to capture high resolution rectilinear panoramic images and visualize Photosynth point clouds and orientation camera parameters. All of them are developed in VVVV programming environment. 3DStudio Max environment is then chosen because of its performance in terms of interactive modeling, UV mapping parameters handling and real time visualization of projected texture on the model surface. Experimental results show how is possible to obtain a 3D photorealistic model using the scale of the spherical photogrammetry restitution to orient web provided point clouds. Moreover the proposed research highlights how is possible to speed up the model reconstruction without losing metric and photometric accuracy. In the same time, using the same panorama dataset, it picks out a useful chance to compare the orientations coming from the two mentioned technologies (Spherical Photogrammetry and Structure for Motion).</jats:p>",

Ideal free distribution (IFD) theory, which suggests that angling quality will be similar on all lakes, is used to drive angler effort distribution. Model parameters are based on creel survey data from 53 lakes and empirical relationships between growth, survival, and density derived from whole-lake density manipulations on nine lakes over a period of 10 years. We compared angling quality, population density, fish size, and yield under unfished conditions, harvest rates that maximize sustained yields (MSY), and an IFD equilibrium driven by angler behavior. The IFD equilibrium rarely maximized yields. Stocks with high MSY angling quality are overexploited at the IFD equilibrium because anglers move to take advantage of exceptional angling opportunities. These stocks would often be viewed as more resistant to harvest pressure because they have higher stock productivities and habitat capacities. However, in our model, they are systematically overharvested because their high fish density attracts excessive angling pressure. Conversely, stocks with low MSY angling quality are underexploited because anglers move to take advantage of better angling quality on other lakes. </jats:p>",

Being able to determine the type of host plant on which field-caught moths fed as larvae would allow for the quantification of mating rates within and between races, as well as the quantification of the spatial distribution and oviposition of both races in the field. We found that stable carbon isotopes (\u03b4;<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C) are a reliable indicator of host-plant photosynthetic type (C3 or C4) regardless of adult food and intensity of metabolism; so even when food or metabolism had a significant effect on wing \u03b4<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C values, the magnitude of this effect was too small to obscure the signal characterizing host-plant type.

From an atmospheric perspective, net of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>removals through sequestration are equivalent to emission reductions over a given period of time. But carbon will not remain sequestered in biomass or soils indefinitely and investments in sequestration could stifle investments in reducing emissions from other sources.

This structure can prompt emission increases in parts of the uncapped entities that weaken the value of emission reductions earned through sequestration.

Myoglobin and iron contents of all the muscles were high, highest being of M. psoas. Fat and glycogen were low in all muscles. The low glycogen value was possibly due to rapid glycolysis during struggle in capture and while the animal was under an overdose of sodium pentobarbital that was administered for killing it. Phosphorylase and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity levels were also low. Lipase (tributyrinase) activity was high, that of M. diaphragma being higher than the other muscles studied. The histochemical investigation revealed some of the morphological and biochemical properties of the component fibers. Two types of fiber, the red (type 1) and white (type 2), comparable to those of other skeletal muscles were distinguished in all muscles except in the case of M. pectoralis where an intermediate type was also seen in sections treated for the histochemical demonstration of SDH activity.The low levels of fat and SDH in the muscles indicate that fat is not a favored metabolite for muscular energy. The significance of the high lipase (tributyrinase) activity is doubtful. It is suggested that the role of this enzyme is to clear the fat so as to prevent the accumulation of fat in the muscles which are, by and large, geared for a glycolytic metabolism as an adaptation for the animal's diving habit. The high myoglobin content of the muscles, however, should provide the oxygen necessary for the oxidation of glucose during the initial part of the dive. </jats:p>",

The objective of these studies was to assess the impact of residue management and row spacing on seed yield under irrigation. A factorial experiment was seeded at Saskatoon, SK, in 1993 to assess the impact of burning or scalping (very close mowing with residue removal) vs. mowing, and 20- vs. 40-cm row spacing on seed yield of Kentucky bluegrass (KBG) (Poa pratensis), creeping red fescue (CRF) (Festuca rubra subsp. rubra) and creeping bentgrass (CBG) (Agrostis palustris). Also, a residue management trial on KBG was seeded at Brooks, AB, in 1993. At Saskatoon, yield was higher at 20-cm spacing across all three species in 1994, but spacing had no impact on winter survival, stand density, tiller growth or yield in subsequent years. Burning and scalping consistently resulted in earlier spring green-up, a higher proportion of fertile tillers, and higher seed yield than mowing. Even with residue management, yield declined after one harvest in CBG and CRF, and after two harvests in KBG. At Brooks, residue management had a similar impact on yield of KBG. A second trial at Brooks examined the impact of row spacing (20, 40, 60 cm) and seeding rate (0.5 to 6 kg seed ha<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>) on KBG. Seed yield was highest at 40-cm spacings in 1994, at 60 cm in 1995, and at 40 to 60 cm in 1996. Seeding rate did not have a consistent effect on yield. We conclude that a combination of residue management and 20- to 40-cm spacings provide the highest, most consistent seed yields for these turfgrass species in this region.

Impacts on the ecology of the lake are well known, but little attention has focused on the ecological status of rivers supplying ecological services to the majority of the basin's over 30 million inhabitants. In this paper, we review existing research on the ecological status of streams and rivers in the Lake Victoria Basin (LVB) and evaluate how they fit into emerging models of riverine ecosystem function in the tropics. Studies to date indicate that allochthonous sources dominate inputs to food webs in forested headwaters and savanna mid\u2010reaches of rivers in the LVB, although transfer pathways vary with position in the river. Although riparian vegetation phenology and hydrologic run\u2010off pathways control the spatial and temporal fluxes of energy inputs in headwater streams; animals play increasingly important roles in savanna mid\u2010reaches.

The study region comprises a range of environments, from large piedmont and intramountain gravel\u2010bed rivers, to small mountain streams. Field measurements and analysis of historical data demonstrate two distinct periods of channel change. From 1850 to 1950, channel narrowing is interpreted to be the result of a recovery process in response to widespread channel destabilization induced by major floods during the second half of the 19th century. At the time, the largely deforested basins were highly responsive to flooding, whereas the recovery process was accelerated by floodplain and basin\u2010scale land use changes (afforestation) and torrential control works, which in turn reduced sediment delivery and enabled vegetation development in channels. From 1950 to 1970, channel narrowing accelerated in most of the studied rivers. This recent phenomenon is considered as a human\u2010induced fluvial adjustment, directly related to forest development on river margins and human abandonment of intensive floodplain land uses. At the same time, long\u2010profile degradation occurred as a result of long\u2010term bedload supply decrease. In small mountain streams, channel narrowing is mainly explained by channel incision which seems to progress from upstream where sediment sources are progressively stabilized by afforestation.

    "text": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Models assume that rainfall is the major source of moisture driving decomposition. Non-rainfall moisture (NRM: high humidity, dew, and fog) can also induce standing litter decomposition, but there have been few standard measurements of NRM-mediated decompositions across sites, and no efforts to extrapolate the contribution of NRM to larger scales to assess whether this mechanism can improve model predictions. Here we show that NRM is an important, year-round source of moisture in grassland sites with contrasting moisture regimes using field measurements and modeling. We first characterized NRM frequency and measured NRM-mediated decomposition in sites on the extreme dry and wet end of grassland systems: at two sites in the Namib Desert, Namibia (hyperarid desert) and at one site in Iowa, USA (tallgrass prairie). NRM was frequent at all sites (85-99% of hours that litter was likely to be wet were attributed to NRM) and tended to occur in cool, high-humidity periods for several hours or more at a time. NRM also caused respiration of standing litter at all sites when litter became sufficiently wet (&gt;5% for fine litter and &gt;13% for coarse), and contributed to mass loss, even in the Namib West site that had almost no rain. When we modeled annual mass loss induced by NRM and rain, and extrapolated our characterization of NRM decomposition to a final site with intermediate rainfall (Sevilleta, New Mexico, semiarid grassland), we found that models driven by rainfall alone underestimated mass loss, while including NRM produced estimates within the range of observed mass loss. Together these findings suggest that NRM is an important missing component in quantitative and conceptual models of litter decomposition, but there is nuance involved in modeling NRM at larger scales. Specifically, temperature and physical features of the substrate emerge as factors that affect the common microbial response to litter wetting under NRM across grasslands sites, and require further study. Hourly humidity can provide an adequate proxy of NRM frequency, but site-specific calibration with litter wetness is needed to accurately attribute decomposition to periods when NRM wets litter. Greater recognition of NRM-driven decomposition and its interaction with other processes (e.g. photodegradation) is needed, especially since fog, dew, and humidity are likely to shift under future climates.</jats:p><jats:sec><jats:title>Manuscript highlights</jats:title><jats:p><jats:list list-type=\"bullet\"><jats:list-item><jats:p>Non-rainfall moisture (NRM; humidity, fog, dew) induces decomposition in grasslands</jats:p></jats:list-item><jats:list-item><jats:p>NRM decomposition depends on substrate type, and occurs at colder times than rain</jats:p></jats:list-item><jats:list-item><jats:p>Including NRM (instead of rain alone) improved predictions of litter decomposition</jats:p></jats:list-item></jats:list></jats:p></jats:sec>",

(Austrian pine) involve large areas of dolomite rock grasslands and have caused the impoverishment or local extinction of the original flora. In addition to these conservation concerns, an important economic problem is the flammability of these forests. Fire risk depends on the amount of accumulated flammable organic components. Thus, the purpose of our research was to quantify the mass of litter accumulated in Austrian pine stands and to examine the correlation between litter mass, stand age, and slope aspect. Forty-eight sampling sites were selected with stand ages ranging from 21 to 108\u00a0years. Stands represented four age classes and three exposure types. At each sampling site, litter mass was determined in the following three fractions: needles, branches, and cones. The litter fractions showed their maximum quantities in age class 61\u201380\u00a0years (needles = 17\u2009560\u00a0kg/ha, branches\u00a0= 2764\u00a0kg/ha, and cones = 2960\u00a0kg/ha). For the needle litter, a significant increase with age was detected through the age classes of 21\u201340, 41\u201360, and 61\u201380\u00a0years, and then a significant decrease occurred in stands above 80\u00a0years. In the case of branch litter, the age-dependent increase was again significant to its maximum quantity, but the decrease in old stands proved to be insignificant. With cone litter, age dependence could not be detected. Exposure of the stands had no effect on the quantities of the three litter fractions. The amount of accumulated litter of Austrian pine stands many times exceed the litter quantity of the rock grasslands (the original vegetation prior to afforestation). Furthermore, it is two or three times higher than the amount of litter reported from native zonal forests of Hungary. Therefore, the Austrian pine stands are subjected to an increased risk of fire, especially in age class 61\u201380\u00a0years.</jats:p>",

    "text": "In forest fires, the fire plume can heat tree crowns and cause the mortality of live vegetation, even though the surface fire spread is of low burning intensity. A lot of empirical or semi-empirical correlations have been built to link the fire intensity and flame height to the crown scorch height. These correlations lack the basic physical processes of heat transfer and thermal response of needles and leaves. Besides the flame height, the fire plume temperature and velocity are also of great importance to quantify the heat transfer to the tree crown. Accordingly, an analytical model, derived from a system of differential equations, describing the conservation of mass, momentum, energy, and chemical composition, is proposed to predict the properties of a fire plume from a line fire. The flame height predicted by the analytical model matches experimental measurements of small, medium, and large line fires, showing a considerable robustness of the proposed model. With an assumption of the lethal temperature of live vegetation, the analytical model can also predict the crown scorch height against available empirical correlations and experimental data. In addition, an analysis of the effect on the flame length of the distance between the fire and the ground surface indicates that it would be better to simulate the wildland fire front by a gaseous line fire above the ground surface. The effect of ambient air temperature and fireline residence time (or heating time of foliage) on the crown scorch height is also quantified. It is found that the hot plume can heat the live foliage to reach a lethal temperature of 60\u00b0C under a heating time of 60 s.",

To achieve this, a tool for a participatory and data\u2010driven assessment considering both the biophysical and socio\u2010economic dimensions of land degradation across scales was developed for Ecuador. In this paper, we present the methodology and results obtained, including the spatially explicit interactive tool developed to integrate indicators that support the scaling\u2010up of sustainable land management (SLM). The process involved specialists from various national and international institutions, as well as decision makers from the public sector and other relevant stakeholders. Cloud computing allowed the integration of five main sources of data: (1) the results of a participatory land degradation assessment based on an expert knowledge questionnaire following the land degradation assessment in drylands (LADA) and world overview of conservation approaches and technologies (WOCAT) methodology; (2) the Hand\u2010in\u2010Hand Initiative Ecuador typology maps based on poverty and estimated agricultural potential and efficiency scores from household surveys; (3) National datasets on land cover and land use, soil properties, and hydro climatic indicators; (4) global satellite\u2010derived LDN indicators, such as land productivity dynamics; and (5) documented SLM practices from WOCAT Global SLM Database.

    "text": "<jats:p>Abstract ContextFeral cats are invasive predators of small and medium-sized fauna throughout Australia. The only broad-scale population-management technique for feral cats currently available in Australia is poison baiting. As poison baits for feral cats must be surface-laid, this can lead to the unintended exposure of non-target species consuming the baits. Encapsulation of a toxin within a robust, controlled-release pellet implanted within the meat lure (the combination of which is termed the Curiosity\u00ae bait) substantially reduces the potential risk to non-target species. Para-aminopropiophenone (PAPP) has been shown to be an effective toxin to which cats are highly susceptible. AimsThe present study aimed to measure the efficacy of encapsulating PAPP toxin in a controlled-release pellet on feral cats in a pen situation and to document the observed behaviours through the toxication process. MethodsPen trials with captive cats were undertaken to document efficacy of encapsulating PAPP toxin in a controlled-release pellet and to assess the behaviours during toxicosis. These behaviours inform an assessment of the humaneness associated with the Curiosity bait using a published relative humaneness model. Key resultsThe trials demonstrated a 95% consumption of the toxic pellet and observed the pattern of behaviours exhibited during the intoxication process. There was a definitive delay in the onset of clinical signs and death followed at ~185min after the first definitive sign. The humaneness using the relative humaneness model was scored at \u2018mild suffering\u2019. ConclusionsThe encapsulating PAPP toxin in a controlled-release pellet for feral cats is effective. The feral cats display a range of behaviours through the toxication process, and these have been interpreted as mild suffering under the relative humaneness model. ImplicationsThe documented efficacy and behaviours of encapsulating PAPP toxin in a controlled-release pellet provides knowledge of how the PAPP toxin works on feral cats, which may assist in decision-making processes for conservation land managers controlling feral cats and whether to incorporate the use of the Curiosity\u00ae bait into existing management techniques.</jats:p>",

Calibration is carried out by using the best linear unbiased predictor (BLUP) theory.

We used two strategies: area-wide protection where semiochemical-releasing flakes are dispersed over the forest floor, and individual tree tests where flakes are applied to tree trunks. The area-wide bioassays were conducted by applying verbenone- and GLV-releasing flakes without stickers to the forest floor on 0.81-ha plots dominated by whitebark pines in the State of Washington with four replicates. We conducted individual tree bioassays by applying the same formulations with stickers to whitebark and limber pines in Montana and Colorado, respectively. In all three situations, both verbenone-alone and verbenone plus GLVs significantly increased the proportion of trees escaping mass attack by beetles, but the two formulations were not significantly different from one another. Despite a lack of significance at a Bonferroni-adjusted \u03b1 = 0.05, adding GLVs gave slightly greater absolute levels of tree protection in most cases. Monitoring traps placed in the area-wide treatments in Washington showed similar outcomes for numbers of beetles trapped: both treatments had significantly fewer beetles than controls, and they were not significantly different from one another. At peak flight, however, plots with GLVs combined with verbenone had roughly 40% fewer beetles than plots with verbenone alone. GLVs are considerably cheaper than verbenone, so tests of higher application rates may be warranted to achieve enhanced tree protection at reasonable cost.",

However, there is the possibility that this result is simply due to the extra attention-getting effect of the breath between the warning tone and the sentence. To test this possibility, the breath was replaced with the sound of rustling leaves. The rustling sounds matched the breaths in duration and loudness.

Accumulating fossil evidence confirms earlier indications that selection for large size in these flying forms resulted in a light, yet strong skeleton characterized by fusion of many bones of the trunk.

We present an alternative hypothesis to recent suggestions of an avian\u2010like mechanism of costosternal pumping as the primary means of aspiration. An analysis of the joints among the vertebrae, ribs, sternum, and pectoral girdle of large pterosaurs indicates limited mobility of the ribcage and sternum.

In this research, a suite of lithofacies from a former distal ice marginal sandur at Orrisdale, Isle of Man, were identified and selected for optically stimulated luminescence dating. Different\u2010size fractions of quartz grains were extracted from selected lithofacies types with the aim of identifying which depositional environments and grain size fractions are best suited for optical dating. Tests have been undertaken to identify the luminescence properties of this quartz, including preheat dose recovery and constant\u2010wave optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) decay curve fitting. Equivalent dose distributions for all samples were wide and positively skewed, indicative of heterogeneous bleaching. A comprehensive statistically based decision\u2010making protocol has been defined in order to find the appropriate statistical model for burial dose estimation. Ages in the range of 17\u201314\u2009ka have been obtained which agree with the expected geologically constrained chronology. The Orrisdale Formation is contemporaneous with Heinrich Event 1 and the Killard Point Stadial identified in eastern Ireland ca. 16.4\u2009ka.

A large number of morpho-biochemical traits and RFLP and RAPD markers are mapped on different linkage groups, but to this point very little attention has been given to unravelling the genetics of yield traits. To address this issue, polymorphic profiles of 147 markers generated with 12 ISSR primers on the genomic DNA of 20 silkworm stocks of diverse yield status were subjected to multiple regression and discriminant function analyses (DFA). This led to the identification of eight markers generated by six primers, which demonstrated high \u03b2-coefficient indices of \u00960.451 to \u00960.940.

This study aimed to analyze vegetation productivity underlying factors in order to assess land degradation and to highlight the impact of definitions on its quantitative assessment, using Mozambique as case-study. Land productivity change were first analyzed using NDVI time-series (2000\u20132016), and a two-step framework was then used to understand the main factors of these productivity changes. The impact of land degradation's definition was assessed based on four types of stakeholder, with different priorities in terms of ecosystem services. The results show that 25% of the country display a significant land productivity decrease, while only 3% display a land productivity increase. A large part of these land productivity changes (>61% of the decrease, and >98% of the increase) is directly assigned to human activities, such as native forest growth or tree plantations (for the increase), or forest degradation, deforestation and loss of grassland productivity (for the decrease). We showed that the fraction of degraded land varies according to stakeholders' definitions, ranging from 12% to 20% of the Country, much less than the 39% estimated by Tier 1 United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification. This study provides a sound methodological framework for assessing land degradation status that could help stakeholders to design national and locally relevant land degradation mitigation policies or programmes.",

Therefore, as a remedy for identifiability problems, the model has been modified slightly on the basis of identifiability analysis and initial estimations and the set of parameters to be estimated has been restricted. A division of the parameters into two groups is sought: those estimated with all plots combined and those that are allowed to vary from plot to plot.

Recent empirical evidence from experimental populations of fruit flies suggests that demographic signals inherent in the counts of seasonal populations, including reproduction and survival, can indicate when in the annual cycle habitat loss occurred. However, it remains unclear whether these signatures of season-specific decline are detectable under a wider range conditions. Here, we use a bi-seasonal Ricker model previously developed and applied to the same experimental system to examine season-specific signals of population decline induced by different rates of habitat loss in the breeding or non-breeding season and different strengths of density dependence. Consistent with the findings in Drosophila, breeding habitat loss was accompanied by reduced reproductive output and a density-dependent increase in survival during the subsequent non-breeding period. Non-breeding habitat loss resulted in reduced non-breeding survival and a density-dependent increase in reproduction in the following breeding season. These season-specific demographic signals of decline were present under a wide range of habitat loss rates (2-25% per generation) and different density-dependent regimes (weak, moderate, and strong). We show that stronger density dependence can negatively influence time to extinction when non-breeding habitat is lost, whereas the strength of density dependence does not influence time to extinction with breeding habitat loss (although, in all cases, density dependence itself was an important modulator of population dynamics). Our results illustrate the need to incorporate seasonality in theoretical models to better understand when populations are being driven to decline.</jats:p>",

Advanced robots have to cope with many different situations emerging at runtime, while executing complex tasks. They should be programmed as dynamically adaptive systems, capable of adapting themselves to the execution environment, including the computing, user, and physical environment. Recently, dynamic languages are becoming widely used because of the high runtime adaptability they offer. Therefore, we have analyzed the suitability of these languages to implement robotic systems with high runtime adaptability requirements, using Python as case study because of its maturity. To evaluate their suitability, we have implemented a reflective robotics framework that can be programmed in both Java and any dynamic language supported by the standard Java Scripting API. An example scenario has been developed using Python to show how its distinguishing meta-programming features have facilitated the development of runtime-adaptable robotics services.

The approach taken here is to combine these complementary techniques into an integrated one: CASA-constrained array processing. In principle, this integrated approach should provide a performance gain since the information used by array processing (direction of propagation through a sound-field) is independent of other CASA features (fundamental frequency, on/offset, etc.). One difficulty encountered by CASA that can be overcome by array processing is the sequential grouping of spectrally dissimilar phonemes in a speech signal, such as a fricative followed by a vowel. The method presented here differs from standard array processing by the addition of CASA features for the signal separation decision.

However, before agronomy can translate this into practical antiresistance strategies, there is a need to direct more resources to the biochemistry and cell biology of pests, diseases and weeds to translate these new discoveries into key tools needed to manage resistance in the future.

Individuals of both species learned a suite of behaviors that enhanced foraging efficiency on a novel seed species under natural conditions. Handling time per seed and return time (travel time to and from the nest and time inside the nest) decreased for both species. Each species also used specific harvest techniques that enhanced foraging efficiency. Individuals of the larger P. rugosus increased efficiency by increasing the number of seeds harvested per trip. As a result, the percentage of individuals that carried > 1 seed per trip increased over time. The smaller M. pergandei decreased the number of seeds handled before harvesting one, and still harvested heavier than average seeds because they handled but did not harvest lightweight seeds. Messor pergandei also varied the number of seeds handled before harvesting one, such that the fewest number of seeds was handled at low natural seed densities. Overall, foraging efficiency of M. pergandei and P. rugosus individuals, measured as seed mass harvested per unit time, increased 1.9\u2014 and 3.85\u2014fold, respectively, within one observation period, even excluding the effect of harvesting heavier than average seeds. The difference between species arose because individuals of P. rugosus could carry twice as many of the test seeds as M. pergandei. Memory was clearly an important component of foraging efficiency for both species, as all foraging efficiency indices fell much more slowly than they rose. Tactile\u2014associated behaviors, such as handling time per seed and number of seeds handled, were lost quickly compared to olfactory\u2014associated behaviors such as seed recognition and acceptance.",

Two primary objectives of this mark\u2014recapture study were to: (1) quantify variation in age structure, age and size at maturity, age\u2014specific survivorship and fecundity, and individual growth rates, and (2) conduct a series of density reduction experiments designed to elucidate the effects of density on growth rates and survival of posthatchling lizards. In addition, we examined the relationships of variation in population density and deviation from long\u2014term average precipitation and temperature to variation in individual growth, reproduction, and demography. At both sites the active season was \u00b0160 d, extending from early April to mid\u2014September. Reproduction occurred during a 50\u2014d period between mid\u2014May and early July. Mean clutch size was 3.7 eggs and most females produced their first clutch in the 2nd yr of life (their third active season) at an age of \u00b022\u201424 mo and a minimum snout\u2014vent length of \u00b050 mm. Most mature females produced two clutches of eggs per year, and there was no statistically significant variation in either mean clutch size or body\u2014size\u2014adjusted clutch size among the 11 yr of study. Clutch size was significantly correlated with body size. Relative clutch mass averaged 0.247 and was not significantly correlated with body size. Since hatchlings first appeared in early to mid\u2014August, their first growing season was \u00b02 mo long. There was no significant sexual dimorphism in growth rate or body size in either population. There was great variation in estimates of egg\u2014yearling survival among years. Egg\u2014yearling survival probability varied from 0.12 to 0.59 with a mean of 0.28. At Ponderosa Flat, the survival of yearling males (0.38) was significantly lower than that of yearling females (0.47). Survival of yearling males (0.45) and females (0.43) at Rattlesnake Ridge was not significantly different. There were no other significant differences in the survival of males and females (X = 0.56 for both sexes) within any age class in any year of the study. However, the survival of yearlings was significantly lower than that of older lizards in both populations. Mean posthatchling survival over all years was 0.45, and there was significant heterogeneity in posthatchling survival among years. Average annual survival of immigrants (0.32) was significantly lower than that of residents (0.44). There was a significant negative linear relationship between yearling body size in late June and total density of posthatchling lizards. A stepwise linear regression model revealed significant effects of both rainfall (and presumably resource availability) and population density on the growth of yearlings. This model explained 78% of the annual variation in yearling growth. Rank correlation analysis revealed that survivorship of hatchlings was negatively correlated with density of conspecific lizards. The negative correlation implies direct density dependence of hatchling mortality rates and is a potentially important mechanism of population regulation. Removals of almost all yearling and older age lizards from the study sites resulted in significant increases in growth rates of hatchlings in the year of the removal and yearlings during the following year. Four results from this study combine to suggest substantial resource limitation of S. graciosus on the Kolob Mesa. (1) Snout\u2014vent lengths attained by yearling lizards were positively correlated with deviations from long\u2014term mean rainfall values. (2) Body sizes attained by yearlings were greatest in the years following density reductions. (3) Body size attained by yearlings was negatively correlated with density of conspecifics. And (4), in a year in which a density reduction followed a warm, wet spring, more yearling females reached maturity than in all other years of the study combined.",

They comprise chemically heterogeneous substances that share a common biochemical target in fungi, the inhibition of a specific step in sterol biosynthesis. Several DMIs are suspected to disrupt endocrine-mediated processes in a range of organisms and to inhibit ecdysteroid biosynthesis in arthropods. It is unclear, however, whether and, if so, to what extent different DMI fungicides have a similar mode of action in nontarget organisms, which in turn would lead to a common chronic toxicity profile. Therefore, we selected a representative of each of the major DMI classes\u2014-the piperazine triforine, the pyrimidine fenarimol, the pyridine pyrifenox, the imidazole prochloraz, and the triazole triadimefon\u2014-and comparatively investigated their chronic toxicity to Daphnia magna. No toxicity was detectable up to the limit of solubility of triforine (61 \u03bcmol/L). All other DMIs reduced reproductive success by delaying molting and development and by causing severe developmental abnormalities among offspring. Prochloraz was most toxic (median effective concentration [EC50] for fecundity reduction, 0.76 \u03bcmol/L), followed by fenarimol (EC50, 1.14 \u03bcmol/L), pyrifenox (EC50, 3.15 \u03bcmol/L), and triadimefon (EC50, 5.13 \u03bcmol/L). Mean effect concentrations for fecundity reduction were related to lipophilicity and followed baseline toxicity. However, triadimefon and fenarimol (but none of the other tested DMIs) caused severe eye malformations among exposed offspring. Affected neonates did survive, but a reduced ecological fitness can be assumed. Offspring exposed to fenarimol in mater matured earlier.

The results demonstrated the utility of benthic macroinvertebrate abundance, density, richness, size, reproduction, locomotion and feeding modes to assess flow regime and water quality variability. Changes in the macroinvertebrate communities were closely associated with seasonal differences in parameters such as temperature, turbidity and nutrients, which were modulated by substrate particle size and heterogeneity. Modification of the flow regime, as a result of river regulation, influences the composition, structure and functioning of river ecosystems and is reflected in changes to the aquatic communities they support. The results of this study highlight the extreme complexity of the links between physicochemical, hydrological and biological processes in lotic systems and the need to better understand these links in order to develop and implement optimal environmental flow regimes in regulated rivers.

Studies of mountain plovers in shortgrass steppe during the 1970s and 1990s were focused in Weld County, Colorado, which was considered a key breeding area for the species. These studies, however, did not include habitats influenced by black\u2010tailed prairie dogs (\n              Cynomys ludovicianus\n              ) or prescribed fire.

During 2008\u20132009, I used radial distance point count surveys to estimate mountain plover densities early in the nesting season in 4 habitats on public lands in Weld County, Colorado. All 4 habitats were grazed by cattle during the growing season at moderate stocking rates but had different additional disturbances consisting of 1) dormant\u2010season prescribed burns, 2) active black\u2010tailed prairie dog colonies, 3) black\u2010tailed prairie dog colonies affected by epizootic plague in the past 1\u20132 years, and 4) rangeland with no recent history of fire or prairie dogs.

Some of the commonly used pesticides are the insecticide chlorpyrifos and the fungicide iprodione; being thus critically essential to develop bioremediation methods to remove these contaminants by tolerant-bacteria. In this study we selected and characterized different pesticides-tolerant bacteria isolated from a biomixture of a biopurification system that had received continuous applications of a mixture of the pesticides chlorpyrifos and iprodione.  Out of the 10 isolated bacterial colonies, only six strains presented adequate growth in presence of the both pesticides at 100 mg L-1. Biochemical and enzymatic characterization using API ZYM showed that all isolates (100%) were positive for esterase, leucine aminopeptidase, acid phosphatase, and naphthol-AS-BI-phosphohydrolase. According to the molecular level study of the 16S ribosomal gene and MALDI TOF/TOF MS, it was possible to determine that the isolated bacteria belong to the genera Pseudomonas, Rhodococcus and Achromobacter. Bacterial growth decreased proportionally (R2 &gt; 0.96) as been as both pesticide concentrations increased from 10 to 100 mg L-1. Achromobacter sp. strain C1 showed the best chlorpyrifos removal (between 56\u201329%) after 120 h of incubation.

This paper describes how some of these methods can be easily understood from a unified point of view. The approach is to begin with the now standard separable age-structured model, and modify some of the basic assumptions. The resulting models are examined using Monte Carlo simulation, with the mean square error of modeled biomass estimates used as the evaluation criterion. Simulation results indicate that nonlinear least squares and multinomial maximum likelihood are both capable of fitting lognormally and multinomially distributed catch-at-age data. It also appears that errors in modeling results introduced by ageing error may be minor, provided ageing error is of modest magnitude and is normally distributed. However, use of a somewhat incorrect functional form for the selectivities can cause greatly increased error in the modeling results, indicating that caution should be exercised when modeling selectivities. Results indicate that length-based SSPA is feasible. And finally, the models are used to provide insight into the old question of \"how many fish should be aged?\" </jats:p>",

Nutrient export will likely increase from logged watersheds, with changes in microbial processes being more strongly associated with nitrogen (N) losses and erosional processes more strongly linked to phosphorus (P) losses. Effects of fire on Boreal Plain soils will increase with fire severity. Coarser soils after fire should be subject to hydrophobicity, erosion, and low infiltration rates.

Land managers in arid zones face the challenge of managing vast, remote landscapes that support numerous cryptic species that are difficult to detect and monitor. Although researchers and land managers are using an increasingly wider variety of monitoring techniques to detect and monitor species, little is known of the relative effectiveness and comparative costs of these techniques. Aims The present study simultaneously assessed the efficacy of three popular monitoring techniques utilised in the spinifex sand plains of arid Australia, namely, live trapping, sign surveys and passive infrared (PIR)-camera trapping. Methods We explored variations in capture rates and species richness for each technique and compared initial and on-going costs of the techniques over time. Key results Sign surveys detected the greatest number of species and groups overall. Detectability of small mammals and reptiles, as a target group, was greater using PIR cameras, although the probability of detection by each technique varied among specific species. PIR cameras were initially the most expensive technique; however, the low ongoing costs of maintaining cameras in the field meant that they became the most cost effective after eight survey periods. Conclusions Each of the techniques tested here showed biases towards the detection of specific groups or species in the spinifex sand-plain habitat of Australia. Regardless, PIR cameras performed better at detecting the greatest diversity of target species and financially over time. Implications To accurately survey species across vast areas and climate variations, studies often extend over long time periods. Many long-term studies would be likely to benefit financially from the increased deployment of PIR cameras alongside or in place of live trapping surveys, with little impact on the ability to monitor the presence of most species in the region.",

Currently used mixed logit models are too expensive, and their performance degrades with increasing dimensionality. To overcome those shortcomings, two new simple and practical techniques are proposed, namely, quasi Monte Carlo (QMC) with generalized antithetic draws and the double base shuffling method (QMC with generalized antithetic draws and double base shuffling). In a comparison of the performance on probability evaluation, the proposed methods are found to be statistically superior (more accurate and precise) to conventional Halton draws for various dimensions. Results show that proposed methods, unlike conventional Halton draws, are less susceptible to dimensional deterioration even at higher dimensions. Computational experiments with real and synthetic data sets also reveal that the proposed methods are significantly faster for simulated estimation of mixed logit models (at higher dimensions) than other benchmark models [standard Halton, modified Latin hypercube sampling (MLHS), and shuffled Halton draws] to achieve similar accuracy levels. For the real data, the proposed method is 2.1 times faster than conventional QMC for 15 dimensions. The speedup of the proposed methods with synthetic data sets of 15 and 30 dimensions is even greater. The speedup ratio of the proposed methods is 3.3 to 3.4 with respect to conventional Halton draws, and the factor ranges from 2 to 3.2 with respect to MLHS and shuffled Halton draws. Thus, the proposed QMC methods offer promise for the development of richer and more flexible discrete choice models in large dimensional choice contexts.",

One aspect of harvesting practice that has received little research attention is the effect of multiple rotations on available habitat, and its use by fauna. Aims We examined one component of habitat that is critical to many taxa, coarse woody debris (CWD). In forests of north-eastern New South Wales, Australia, we aimed to assess whether harvest (moderate intensity for saw-logs) frequency influences CWD levels, and whether fauna activity on CWD varies with harvest frequency and with CWD attributes. Methods Using habitat surveys and camera trapping, we compared CWD quantity and quality in unharvested sites with those that had been harvested once, twice and three times, and assessed fauna use of CWD. Key results We found significantly greater volume of non-hollow CWD, and of medium-sized pieces (15\u201330 cm diameter), in sites harvested three times versus unharvested sites. Camera trapping showed that the activity and composition of fauna were similar across these harvest treatments. Our results also found that a broad range of fauna used a variety of logs, including large and small logs in various states of decay. Conclusions Consistent with other Australian studies, our results suggested that there are no detectable impacts of harvesting on hollow or large CWD. Further studies using radio-tracking or similar methods are needed to more comprehensively assess how CWD is used by fauna. Implications CWD was used broadly by a range of species and should be targeted for retention under ecologically sustainable forest management practices to ensure that it continues to be present in harvested landscapes.

Odours that attract fruit flies can help control these pests and this study investigated how six fruit fly species smell these chemicals. The strength of fly responses to tested odours gives insight into the way flies smell and provides information for making better attractants, potentially reducing insecticide use.\nAbstractThe Queensland fruit fly (Bactrocera tryoni, Q-fly) is a major horticultural pest in eastern Australia. The deployment of male lures comprises an important component of several detection and control strategies for this pest. A novel fluorinated analogue of raspberry ketone (RK), raspberry ketone trifluoroacetate (RKTA), has been developed with the aim of further improving Q-fly control. RKTA elicited strong electroantennogram (EAG) responses from Q-flies whereas cuelure (CL) and melolure (ML) responses were not significantly greater than a negative control. Further experimentation showed that RKTA also elicited EAG response from five other fruit fly species, included flies known to be strongly attracted to CL (B. neohumeralis, B. kraussi and B. frauenfeldi), weakly attracted to CL (B. jarvisi), or non-responsive to CL (Zeugodacus cucumis), whereas seven other compounds, RK, CL, ML, raspberry ketone difluoroacetate, raspberry ketone monofluoroacetate, anisyl acetone and trimethylsilyl raspberry ketone, elicited only weak responses comparable with a negative control. However, fly EAG responses to RKTA are likely due at least in part to trifluoroethanoic acid, which is a hydrolysis product of RKTA and elicited strong EAG responses from all six species when tested alone. Furthermore, whereas ethanoic acid, methanoic acid and trifluoroethanoic acid all elicited strong EAG responses in Q-flies, the only corresponding RK ester to elicit an EAG response was RKTA, suggesting that RKTA hydrolyses quickly, whereas CL and ML do not. This is in contrast to the idea that CL readily hydrolyses on contact with atmospheric moisture, an assertion that has been made in the literature repeatedly.\n</jats:p>",

The basis for these elements is explained in terms of the experimental and qualitative research that has informed their development. The SIM provides evidence\u2010based guidance for investigative interviewers, and numerous versions have been created to suit different investigation types, interviewee groups, and jurisdictional or organisational requirements. It is continually refined as new findings from experimental research around best\u2010practice interviewing emerge. Rather than a single entity or completed product, the SIM represents a dynamic evolution of research, collaboration, and testing.

Nine instrument-rated pilots were presented with a series of heading-change tasks in a laboratory setting and in a single-place instrument trainer. Two levels of difficulty of each of three tasks were presented verbally (numeric values embedded in simple commands), spatially (headings were depicted on a graphically drawn compass) and combined (each of the previous displays were given simultaneously). In the instrument- trainer setting problems were presented orally by one of the experimenters and no effort was made to manipulate display types. Performance was measured by evaluating the speed (response times) and accuracy (percent correct and time outs) of the responses. The workload experienced by the pilots under each experimental condition was determined by responses to a standard set of bipolar rating scales. These subjective measures reflected the differences between levels of difficulty and types of tasks, but were generally insensitive to the manipulation of display type. The performance measures, however, displayed significant differences for all manipulations. Problems presented in the combined and alpha display formats, were done significantly faster and with significantly greater <i>accuracy</i> than problems in the compass format alone suggesting that the pilots were primarily using the alpha information contained in the combined display to perform the calculations.

However, whether the robustness to environmental stress (environmental canalization [EC]) and to genetic variation (genetic canalization) are underpinned by the same molecular basis remains elusive. The recent discovery of the involvement of two endoplasmic reticulum (ER)\u2010associated DnaJ genes in developmental buffering, orthologues of which are conserved across Metazoa, indicates that the role of ER\u2010associated DnaJ genes might be conserved across the animal kingdom. To test this, we surveyed the ER\u2010associated DnaJ chaperones in the nematode\n              Caenorhabditis elegans\n              . We then quantified the phenotype, in the form of variance and mean of seam cell counts, from RNA interference knockdown of DnaJs under three different temperatures. We find that seven out of eight ER\u2010associated DnaJs are involved in either EC or microenvironmental canalization. Moreover, we also found two DnaJ genes not specifically associated with ER (DNAJC2/\n              dnj\u201011\n              and DNAJA2/\n              dnj\u201019\n              ) were involved in canalization. Protein expression pattern showed that these DnaJs are upregulated by heat stress, yet not all of them are expressed in the seam cells. Moreover, we found that most of the buffering DnaJs also control lifespan. We therefore concluded that a number of DnaJ chaperones, not limited to those associated with the ER, are involved in canalization as a part of the complex system that underlies development.",

The compound effect of drainage and wildfire resulted in a shift of the surface datum down the peat profile, revealing denser peat. Less-dense near-surface peats that regulate water-table position and near-surface moisture content, both favourable to Sphagnum recolonization, were lost. At a drained peatland that was then subject to wildfire, peat bulk density increased by 14.1%, von Post humification class increased by two categories and water retention increased by 15.6%, compared with an adjacent burned but undrained (single disturbance) portion of the fen.

Survival of preimaginal P. chephrenis was similar, independent of host species or its infestation status. Preimaginal X. ramesis had a higher survival rate when their parents fed on preinfested than on pristine typical hosts, whereas no effect of infestation status of an atypical host was found. P. chephrenis developed faster if their parents fed on atypical than on typical hosts and on pristine than on preinfested hosts of either species. X. ramesis developed faster if parents fed on pristine than preinfested typical hosts, but no difference in duration of development was found for atypical hosts. Under starvation, P. chephrenis lived longer if their parents fed on preinfested than on pristine typical hosts, but their lifespan did not depend on infestation status of atypical hosts.

In autumn 1997, the experimental area was treated with 4 rates (6.0 t/ha, 3.0 t/ha, 1.5 t/ha, nil) of finely-ground agricultural limestone and sown with 5 pasture species: lucerne (Medicago sativa), barrel medic (M. truncatula), subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum), rose clover (T. hirtum) and ryegrass (Lolium rigidum). The pastures were removed with herbicide and cultivation in September 2000. The land lay fallow for 9 months and then was sown to wheat (Triticum aestivum) in autumn 2001 and again in autumn 2002. The most probable numbers of soil (0\u201310 cm) populations of the root\u2013nodule bacterium for Medicago species (Sinorhizobium meliloti) and for the Trifolium species (Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. trifolii) were counted in May 2001 and May 2002. Soil pH, which was significantly (P&lt;0.05) elevated 12 months after liming, declined substantially during the next 4 years although there was no concomitant decline in the pH of unlimed soil. The pasture species were highly productive of both pasture dry matter and nitrogen. The majority of legume pasture nitrogen was a consequence of symbiotic nitrogen fixation. There was a small but significant (P&lt;0.05) dry matter response to application of lime in lucerne and barrel medic, and a larger nitrogen response to liming in lucerne, barrel medic and rose clover. Nitrogen fixation by rose clover appeared suboptimal. It was assumed from the density of plants that large populations of rhizobia developed in the soil during the growth of the legumes. Nine months after removal of the pasture, rhizobia numbers had fallen to low levels but did not fall further during the following year. The initial fall was attributed to high soil temperatures and low soil moisture during the Condobolin summer. The population of rhizobia for Trifolium species was about twice that of the rhizobia for Medicago species but the difference was not statistically significant. Liming had an overriding influence on the size of rhizobial populations, except in plots that had previously grown ryegrass where numbers remained low irrespective of rate of liming. Overall, most probable numbers escalated with each increase in rate of liming, from 10/g soil in the nil lime plots to 708/g in the 6 t/ha lime plots. The rhizobial homology of the pasture species (i.e. Sinorhizobium meliloti for the Medicago species and Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. trifolii for the Trifolium species) had an underlying but major influence on most probable numbers and in determining which rhizobial species occurred more commonly. Estimated populations of rhizobia in soils from homologous legumes were about 8 times those found in soils from non-homologous legumes. The benefits of applying lime to this red-brown earth soil may not have been merely a consequence of correction of low soil pH; increased levels of calcium may also have had a role. The results are discussed in relation to re-establishment of legume leys after the cereal phase of the cropping system.</jats:p>",

We discuss habitat-directed surveys for rare floral elements in the context of landscape-level management planning, focusing in particular upon a case study from southern New Brunswick. Databases of rare species and community occurrences are important requisites for such planning, but existing information is usually deficient and expensive to develop. A habitat-based approach directs surveys to sites with a higher-than-random probability of hosting rare elements and avoids areas deemed unlikely to be of interest due to environment or disturbance factors. We describe a four-part survey procedure that uses readily available qualitative habitat descriptions and geographic information systems (GIS) based land resource data to identify sites potentially hosting rare biota. The procedure includes remote-sensed and on-site screening to confirm significance and collect ancillary data needed for conservation planning. The use of existing data is cost and time efficient, a necessity given often narrow planning windows and restricted budgets. The method described here is well suited to geographically restricted plant biota associated with distinct habitats, especially in unsurveyed or highly fragmented landscapes. However, the approach does not apply to species of wide-ranging and environmentally heterogeneous habitats. As well, by targeting only highly specific locations assumed to be \"optimal\" habitat, the occurrence of rare biota in other areas cannot be definitively determined and some sites will almost certainly be missed.

More efficient water application technologies and water management practices are ways of realising potential water savings, thus moderating the negative impacts of higher water use on farm incomes and environmental impact on rivers and groundwater systems. This paper describes an integrated approach of agro-hydrological modelling for determining potential water savings achievable by adopting high-tech irrigation technologies at farm level and application of GIS techniques to upscale those benefits at the regional irrigation system level. The SWAP (Soil\u2013Water\u2013Atmosphere\u2013Plant) model was used for the simulation of water use at the farm level. The results are promising, as the potential water saving ranges from 0.1 to 2.2 ML ha\u22121 (10\u2013220 mm) for different broad-acre crops, 1.0 to 2.0 ML ha\u22121 (100\u2013200 mm) in sprinkler and 2.0 to 3.0 ML ha\u22121 (200\u2013300 mm) in drip irrigation for citrus, 1.0 to 1.5 ML ha\u22121 (100\u2013150 mm) in sprinkler and up to 4.0 ML ha\u22121 (400 mm) in drip irrigation for vineyards and 0.5 to 1.0 ML ha\u22121 for vegetables (50\u2013100 mm). SWAP simulations show crop water saving potential of 7% for maize, 15% for soybean, 17% for wheat, 35% for barley, 17% for sunflower and 38% for fababean from the current water use statistics in Australia. Spatial analysis in GIS environment is carried out to investigate the spatial variations of water use for a particular crop under different depths to water table and varying soil types. Maps of water need for all broad-acre crops are drawn and pixel-to-pixel comparison is performed to determine the water saving potential per unit area. The upscaling approach shows that considerable water amounts could be saved both in Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area (MIA) and Coleambally Irrigation Area (CIA) with potential water saving of 36 to 95 GL (MCM) in MIA and 42 to 72 GL (MCM) in CIA.

Thus, co-infection of a defensive symbiont and a parasite is predicted to select both for increased virulence in co-infecting symbionts and for increased defense in the protective symbiont. Why then do we observe defensive mutualists that protect hosts while causing little damage? To address this question, we build a symbiont-centered model that incorporates the evolution of two independent traits: defense and virulence. Virulence is modeled as a continuous trait spanning mutualism (negative virulence) and parasitism (virulence) and thus accounts for the entire range of direct effects that symbionts have on host mortality. Defense is modeled as a continuous trait that ameliorates the costs to the host associated with co-infection with a deleterious parasite. We obtain the counterintuitive result that the evolution of increased defense in one symbiont largely leads to the evolution of lower virulence in both symbionts and may even facilitate pathogens evolving to mutualism. However, results are context-dependent and when defensive traits are costly, the evolution of greater defense may also lead to higher virulence.</jats:p>",

These chromosomes proved suitable for full polytene analysis. Thoracic trichogen cells of both male and female pupae also contain useful polytene chromosomes, although they are considerably thinner and thus more difficult to analyze. Contrasting with those in pupal trichogen cells, the chromosomes in the salivary glands, Malphighian tubules, midgut, hindgut, and fat body of larvae and pupae were difficult to prepare because of high levels of ectopic pairing and chromosome fragmentation. In hindgut preparations partial separation of up to three chromosomes was achieved, but in all other tissues no useful chromosome separation was possible. In trichogen polytene cells, five banded chromosomes and a prominent heterochromatic network associated with a nucleolus are found. The mitotic chromosomes respond to C- and Q-banding and silver staining with considerable variation. This is especially so in the X chromosome, which displays an extensive array of bands following both Q-banding and silver staining. Comparison of Q-banded metaphase and polytene chromosomes demonstrates that the five autosomes are represented by conventional polytene chromosomes, while the sex chromosomes are contained in the heterochromatic net, most of which fluoresces strongly. This suggests that the Q-bands of the mitotic X chromosome are replicated to a greater extent than the nonfluorescent material in polytene cells.

I test the underlying assumption that the females of monogamous anthropoid primates are overdispersed in three different ways, and compare the results with data for several polygynous primate genera. First, I show that monogamous primates do not have per capita territories that are significantly larger than those of polygynous taxa. Second, given their day journey length and the Mitani-Rodman equation (Mitani &amp; Rodman 1979), males of most monogamous species could easily defend areas large enough to allow them to monopolise 5-6 females. Finally, I use a model of male mate searching strategies to show that, unlike the males of polygynous species, the males of monogamous species would sire more offspring by adopting a roving male form of polygyny when females are dispersed. The opportunity cost that monogamous males incur is typically more than five times the reproductive success they have by being obligately monogamous, suggesting that the selection pressure preventing them from pursuing a roving male strategy is very considerable. Given that biparental care always follows the adoption of monogamy in primate evolution, the only viable explanation for monogamy would seem to be either high predation risk or high infanticide risk.</jats:p>",

The existence of closely related species in the same habitat provides a particularly useful opportunity to examine this issue. A variety of floral traits likely to be associated with the reproductive system of three sympatric Vaccinium species (V. myrtillus, V. vitis-idaea, and V. uliginosum) were quantified in a heathland in the Upper Ardennes, Belgium. These traits included the length and width of the corolla, the number and size of the anthers, the number of pollen tetrads and ovules, and the length of the style. Pollen to ovule ratios suggest a mixed mating system in the three species. The greater pollen to ovule ratio and stigma\u2013anther separation in V. vitis-idaea suggest that it functions more as an outcrosser than the two congeners. The effects of caging, emasculation, and artificial pollination on fruit and seed set differed among years and among the three species. Supplementary pollination increased fruit set and fruit characteristics (particularly seed number) relative to natural pollination in the three species. The three species showed a varied but poor capacity to self in the absence of pollinators. Seed set per fruit was lower in the spontaneously selfed flowers in comparison with hand-crossed pollinated flowers in V. myrtillus and V. vitis-idaea but not in V. uliginosum. This higher ability to self in V. uliginosum indicates a lower capacity to self in the absence of pollinators. However, all the three species were at least partially self-compatible. Together the floral traits and selfing ability suggest that the polyploid V. uliginosum appears to be more highly selfing than the two diploids, particularly V. vitis-idaea.

Productivity of owls did not differ between those using the contaminated and uncontaminated areas. Adults in the uncontaminated area had nominally higher survival from 15 January-15 August. Mortalities related to dieldrin in adults were most likely the result of mobilization of dieldrin from other tissues due to nutritional stress associated with reproduction. Interval survival of juveniles in contaminated and uncontaminated areas was similar, however, dieldrin residue in plasma at nine weeks of age was strongly and negatively related to survival; juveniles with higher dieldrin residues died during dispersal. Plasma dieldrin concentrations in juveniles correlated with dieldrin levels in soil and prey within parental home ranges. Consequently, sampling dieldrin in juvenile plasma is a more reliable method for monitoring the impact of dieldrin than counting number of young fledged per nest.",

Soil and ecosystem degradation occurs when erosion exceeds on\u2010 and off\u2010site soil loss tolerances, with significant socioeconomic and environmental impacts. In the last 50 years, the Brazilian Cerrado had 53% of its original vegetation converted to agriculture and pastureland. Although erosion plot studies exist in the region, the data are fragmented and unexplored, hindering the development of soil conservation policies. The objective of the present research was to compile, systematize, and statistically analyze the existing erosion plot data in the Brazilian Cerrado, correlating the observed results with different environmental and management factors, and with the corresponding soil loss tolerances. Twenty runoff plot datasets of the Brazilian Cerrado, encompassing 5 states, 10 sites, 108 plots, and 360 plot\u00b7years were compiled and thoroughly analyzed. Mean annual rainfall, runoff, and soil loss were 1443.5 mm year\n              \u22121\n              , 83.1 mm year\n              \u22121\n              , and 8.9 Mg ha\n              \u22121\n              year\n              \u22121\n              , respectively. After the data were normalized with respect to plot length, steepness, and climate, runoff and soil loss were found to be significantly higher in soils with impermeable horizons and in land uses without permanent soil cover (\n              p\n              < 0.05). Erosion under permanently covered plots was below the on\u2010 and off\u2010site soil loss tolerances. A power equation provided the best fit between plot runoff and soil loss (\n              R\n              2\n              = 0.71;\n              p\n              < 0.05), indicating that runoff volume, easier to estimate, could be used as a proxy for upslope erosion.

By comparing the trap catches with sediment cores taken at all three stations, a resuspension model for dry weight, POC, and PN was developed. The calculations showed that newly formed organic material is resuspended and redeposited more frequently at nearshore locations than offshore. This repeated nearshore resuspension enhances decomposition of detritus, as shown by low relative phytoplankton activity in the hypolimnetic traps, and results in horizontal transport of fine-grained organic matter in the offshore direction.

The soil nutrient content, enzyme activity, bacterial community, and nitrogen-cycling genes were determined.     Key results   T1 had the highest Chao1 and Shannon index, while T3 had the lowest. BS-treated samples had higher relative abundance of Actinobacteria and Chloroflexi than that of CK. Specially, BS-treated samples had higher relative abundance of Sphingomonas, Reyranella, and Hyphomicrobium, which was significantly positively correlated with the content of organic matter, total soluble nitrogen, ammonium nitrogen, and the activity of sucrase. The abundance of genes involved in amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism, metabolism of cofactors, and vitamin functions also increased in the BS-treated samples. BS treatment significantly increased the abundance of AOA-amoA and nirK genes, but decreased the abundance of nirS and nifH genes.     Conclusions   An appropriate amount of BS agent could improve soil fertility, regulate the dominant bacterium communities, and affect the abundance of functional genes involved in nitrogen cycling.     Implications   BS is probably a good choice for mulberry cultivation to improve nitrogen fertiliser utilisation efficiency.</jats:p>",

Broad\u2010scale assessments that address ecosystem diversity cover assessment of viability for most species. We developed an 8\u2010step process to address those species for which management for ecosystem diversity may be inadequate for providing ecological conditions capable of sustaining viable populations. The process includes identification of species of conservation concern, description of source habitats, and other important ecological factors, grouping species, selection of focal species, development of focal species assessment models, development of conservation strategies, and designing monitoring, and adaptive management plans. Following application of our screening criteria, we identified 209 of 700 species as species of conservation concern on National Forest System lands east of the crest of the Cascade Mountains in Oregon and Washington State, USA. We aggregated the 209 species of conservation concern into 10 families and 28 groups based primarily on habitat associations (these are not phylogenetic families). We selected 36 primary focal species (78% birds, 17% mammals, 5% amphibians) for application in northeast Washington State, USA based on risk factors and ecological characteristics. Our assessment documented reductions in habitat capability across northeast Washington State compared to historical conditions. To address such changes, for each focal species we developed conservation strategies that included habitat protection and restoration and amelioration of threats. We combined conservation strategies for individual species with other focal species and with management proposals for other resources (e.g., recreation, fire, and fuels management) to develop a multi\u2010species, multi\u2010resource management strategy. The information generated from our approach can be directly translated into land management planning through development of desired conditions, objectives, and standards and guidelines to improve the probability that desired population outcomes will be achieved. However, it should be noted by practitioners that a practical conservation planning process, such as ours, cannot remove all uncertainty and risk to species viability. \u00a9 2011 The Wildlife Society.",

Runoff event mean concentrations and loads of total and dissolved nitrogen, phosphorus, and carbon in addition to total suspended solids are reported. Brigalow woodland had the greatest loss of sediment and nitrogen attributed to the inherently fertile Vertosols (clay soil), but the low occurrence and amount of runoff meant that it had a low risk to water quality. Despite a similar number of runoff events from the improved pastures, leucaena pasture had less total runoff and a lower maximum peak runoff rate in addition to lower nitrogen and carbon in runoff. Total suspended solids and carbon in runoff were greater from grass pasture than from the leguminous pastures, whereas nitrogen and phosphorus were greatest from the butterfly pea pasture, especially in the first 2\u00a0years post-planting.

The sericulture industry is closely associated with the Assamese traditions and rituals. In non-mulberry silk, Muga silkworm which is endemic to North-East India only produce exquisite silks of golden color. Rearing of Muga silkworm is one of the important aspects to producing silk of high quality. The quality of the primary host plant i.e. Som (<jats:italic>Persea bombycina</jats:italic> Kost.) greatly affects the quality of cocoon and silk produced by these industries. Therefore, planting and growing a disease-free plant has its own importance in sericulture. However, Som is very susceptible to different foliar diseases caused by fungi, which can reduce the yield of leaf from 13.8 - 41.6% annually. Therefore, a comprehensive mycofloral study of the host plant is important to forecast the future diseases and design different disease management procedures.

It analyses the spatial patterns and temporal dynamics of canopy and ground temperatures at unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution to showcase the potential as well as limitations of the FO-DTS technology for ecohydrological applications. By using the partial rhododendron coverage of a deciduous UK woodland as a model system, FO-DTS surveys were carried out to demonstrate the detection of different dynamic thermal patterns in the presence/absence of rhododendron (Rhododendron ponticum L). The high-resolution temperature measurements of this study provide strong evidence for the moderating impact of rhododendron coverage on air, ground and soil temperatures in forest ecosystems, which has important implications for ecological and biogeochemical process dynamics. The results successfully demonstrate the significant potential of FO-DTS for high-resolution, spatially detailed, transient temperature monitoring in forest environments. The survey performance and its very efficient signal-to-noise ratio proves the capability of FO-DTS networks to provide highly accurate information on temporal dynamics in spatial temperature patterns with great prospect for substantially improving spatial coverage and sensitivity of temperature observations in a range of ecological applications.

Arctic foxes consumed lemmings more often than red foxes did, while red foxes consumed field voles and birds more often. Yet despite substantial variation in the diet of each species among summers, food-niche overlaps between the species were consistently high in most summers, as arctic and red foxes responded similarly to temporal changes in prey availability. Occurrences of field voles and birds in fox scats were negatively correlated with altitude, while the occurrences of lemmings tended to increase with altitude. Since arctic foxes bred at higher altitudes than red foxes, the differences between arctic and red fox diets were better explained by altitudinal segregation than by differences between their fundamental food niches.

As one of the significant exotic forest pests, it is imperative that the basic biology of hemlock woolly adelgid be understood for use in novel and improved management techniques. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy and enzyme assays were used to elucidate the feeding biology of hemlock woolly adelgid and are discussed in the context of the pest\u2014plant interactions and the implications for host plant resistance. Morphological characters indicate that hemlock woolly adelgids may use labial sensilla and neural canals within the mandibular stylets to guide their stylets through close-range host acceptance processes. Stylet bundle insertion is likely assisted by external sheath material that secures the stylet bundle to the plant surface and mandibular dentitions that may assist entry into or within plant tissues.

Tropical rainforest\u2013grassland ecotones are shaped through particular fire regimes, creating both gradual and abrupt ecotones. Insectivorous bats contribute considerably to mammalian diversity, and their capacity for flight allows them to use ecotones in a three-dimensional way, making them an informative faunal group for evaluating ecotone use.\nAimsTo critically evaluate how insectivorous bats use gradual and abrupt ecotones between rainforest and grassland habitats.\nMethodsBat detectors were placed every 50m, along 200-m transects, through five gradual and five abrupt rainforest\u2013grassland ecotones. The activity of all insectivorous bats, as well as open, edge\u2013open and closed foraging guilds (defined by echolocation call type), was compared among grassland and rainforest habitats, gradual and abrupt ecotones and positions across the ecotones.\nKey resultsMean total bat activity, mean open and edge\u2013open foraging guild activity were significantly higher in grassland positions, followed by the edge, and were lowest in the rainforest. Closed foraging guild bats showed no preference for either habitats, but had significantly higher activity in gradual compared with abrupt ecotones. Mean activity of edge\u2013open foraging guild bats was affected strongly by the interaction between ecotone type and position along the ecotone. Gradual ecotones had a more even proportion of all three bat foraging guilds along the ecotone compared with abrupt ecotones. Most of these findings were likely driven by the structural complexity of gradual ecotones that fulfilled microhabitat requirements for all three foraging guilds, but may also have been influenced by insect prey abundance.\nConclusionsThe present study demonstrated the importance of grassland patches in a tropical, rainforest landscape, and of gradual rainforest\u2013grassland ecotones for insectivorous bats. Gradual ecotones promote complex habitat mosaics to allow closed foraging guild species to take advantage of food resources provided by grasslands, and provide all bats proximity to potential roosting and foraging sites.\nImplicationsThe data clearly suggest that a suitable fire regime should be used to maintain current grassland patches within a rainforest landscape, and to promote gradual ecotones for use by insectivorous bats.\n</jats:p>",

This contention is supported by the incidence of infestation per month being the same in transients and residents even though residents had a greater overall degree of infestation.

    "text": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) plays an important role in the evolution of many organisms, especially in prokaryotes where commonly occurs. Microbial communities can improve survival due to the evolutionary innovations induced by HGT events. Thus, several computational approaches have arisen to identify such events in recipient genomes. However, this has been proven to be a complex task due to the generation of a great number of false positives and the prediction disagreement among the existing methods. Phylogenetic reconstruction methods turned out to be the most reliable but they are not extensible to all genes/species and are computationally demanding when dealing with large datasets. On the other hand, the so-called surrogate methods that use heuristic solutions either based on nucleotide composition patterns or phyletic distribution of BLAST hits can be applied easily to genomic scale, however, they fail in identifying common HGT events. Here, we present ShadowCaster, a hybrid approach that sequentially combines compositional features under the shadow of phylogenetic models independent of tree reconstruction to improve the detection of HTG events in prokaryotes. ShadowCaster predicted successfully close and distant HTG events in both artificial and bacterial genomes. It detected HGT related to heavy metal resistance in the genome of <jats:italic>Rhodanobacter denitrificans</jats:italic> with higher accuracy than the most popular state-of-the-art computational approaches.

In this study we compared measures of behavioural expression and behaviour in operant tests. We examined the behavioural expression of pregnant ewes of body condition score (BCS) 2 and 3. The ewes were exposed to a feed motivation test in which they received a food reward. Pregnant ewes (48\u201370 days gestation) were assessed during a food motivation test after they had been maintained at BCS 3 (n = 7) or given a decreasing plane of nutrition that resulted in slow loss of 1 BCS unit (over 10\u201312 weeks; n = 7) or a fast loss of 1 BCS unit (over 4\u20136 weeks; n = 7). The feed motivation test involved ewes having the opportunity to approach a food reward and then being moved a given distance away from the reward by an automatic gate; they could then subsequently return to the feeder. Continuous video footage of each ewe during one cycle of the gate (approaching and returning from the food reward) was shown in random order to 11 observers who used their own descriptive terms (free-choice profiling methodology; FCP) to score the animals using QBA. Data of the assessment were analysed with generalised Procrustes analysis (GPA), a multivariate statistical technique associated with FCP. The research group also quantified the feeding behaviour of sheep in the same clips. These behaviours included how sheep approached the feeder, behaviours exhibited at the feeder, and how sheep returned from the feeder. There was consensus amongst observers in terms of their assessment of behavioural expression of the sheep (P &lt; 0.001). The GPA found three main dimensions of assessed behavioural expression in the sheep, which together explained 44% of the variation observed. GPA dimension 1 differed between the three treatment groups (P &lt; 0.05): ewes maintained at BCS 3 scored low on GPA dimension 1 (i.e. were described as more calm/bored/comfortable) compared with ewes that had a slow declining BCS (described as more interested/anxious/excited). GPA dimension 2 scores were not significantly different between treatment groups. However, quantitative behaviours exhibited by sheep during the clips were correlated with qualitative behavioural assessments made by the observers. Animals that spent more time \u2018sniffing and looking for more feed\u2019 were attributed lower GPA 2 scores (described as more hungry/searching/excited) (P &lt; 0.05), and animals that \u2018did not walk directly to the food reward (but stopped along the way)\u2019 were attributed significantly higher GPA 2 scores (more curious/intimidated/uneasy) (P &lt; 0.01). GPA dimension 3 scores also did not differ between the treatment groups; however, sheep that had a higher number of feeding events during the entire 23-h feed motivation test were attributed lower GPA dimension 3 scores (they were described as more hungry/bold/interested) (P &lt; 0.05), and sheep that consumed a larger amount of the feed reward were attributed higher GPA dimension 3 scores (more curious/concerned/reserved) (P &lt; 0.05). We conclude that QBA is a valuable method of assessing sheep behavioural expression under the conditions tested, in that it provided an integrative characterisation of sheep behavioural expression that was in agreement with quantitative behavioural measures of feeding.\n</jats:p>",

Regardless of the plantation-age, the cultivated tree species and the rotation-phase, the ground beetle fauna of the surveyed SRC was dominated by widespread and common generalists. Species of conservation concern (exclusively xerothermophilic species) were found only sporadically and had their main occurrence in the two years following the establishment of the plantation. During this phase, Harpalus griseus, a rare and threatened species in Lower Saxony, was detected in large numbers. After 8 and 9 years respectively, species numbers as well as the number of specimens on the entire SRC and within its different stands were considerably lower than in the early establishment phase. The partial harvest of the poplar and willow stands caused a significant change in ground beetle communities and a strong increase in the activity of openland species. However, openland generalists were the main beneficiaries, while pioneer species like Harpalus griseus occurred only sporadically. Woodland species were found only rarely even in the 9th year after establishment. We conclude that the conservational value of SRC as habitat for ground beetles is generally limited, decreases with increasing plantation-age and that a mosaic of different tree stands, rotation-phases and headlands is not sufficient to promote pioneer species of conservation concern. In order to provide permanently suitable conditions for these species, additional measures extending beyond the regular management of the plantations are required. These should aim at the creation of sun-exposed ruderal habitats with a patchy herb layer and high proportions of bare ground within accompanying structures of SRC like headlands or rides.</jats:p>",

However, quantitative information on the wildlife value of back channels is needed by natural resource managers for the conservation of these forested islands and embayments in the face of increasing shoreline development and recreational boating. We compared the relative abundance of waterbirds, turtles, anurans, and riparian furbearing mammals during 2001 and 2002 in back and main channels of the Ohio River in West Virginia. Wood ducks ( Aix sponsa ), snapping turtles ( Chelydra serpentina ), beavers ( Castor canadensis ), and muskrats ( Ondatra zibethicus ) were more abundant in back than main channels. Spring peepers ( Pseudacris crucifer ) and American toads ( Bufo americanus ) occurred more frequently on back than main channels. These results provide quantitative evidence that back channels are important for several wildlife species. The narrowness of the back channels, the protection they provide from the main current of the river, and their ability to support vegetated shorelines and woody debris, are characteristics that appear to benefit these species. As a conservation measure for important riparian wildlife habitat, we suggest limiting building of piers and development of the shoreline in back channel areas.",

Natural estrogen (17\u03b2-estradiol), three known estrogenic compounds in vertebrates (bisphenol A, 4-nonylphenol, p-t-octylphenol), and an invertebrate molting hormone (20-hydroxyecdysone) were tested for their effects on development and reproductive characters in two successive generations of T. japonicus. Less than 24-h-old nauplii (parentals) were exposed to four sublethal concentrations of these compounds for 21 d at 25\u00b0C. The first brood of nauplii (F1) produced was monitored further under the same culture conditions and exposures to test compounds. Results showed that all estrogenic compounds affected development (both in number of days to reach copepodid stage and sexual maturity) in the parental generation. Similar effects were apparent in the F1; however, fecundity, sex ratio, and survival were not significantly affected, even at concentrations as high as 10 \u03bcg/L (nominal concentration). The invertebrate molting hormone 20-hyroxyecdysone had no detectable effect on any of the endpoints tested but gave the lowest 48-h 50% lethal concentration (LC50) value.

This scolytid can be managed at two points in its biological cycle: in pruned logs, where it excavates reproduction galleries, or in living trees, after emergence from the logs, where it digs feeding galleries. In mortality laboratory bioassays, the efficiency of organophosphorus insecticides has been ranked as follows: chlorpyrifos\u2009+\u2009dimethoate\u2009<\u2009formothion\u2009<\u2009methidathion. Formothion and methidathion, the two most efficient, were sprayed on olive logs together with a pyrethroid insecticide, deltamethrin, and a formulation which combined an organophosphorus (fenitrothion) and a pyrethroid (cypermethrin) insecticide. Deltamethrin inhibited the excavation of new reproduction galleries and induced a repellent effect on the olive pest. In contrast, none of the organophosphorus insecticides or the combination, fenitrothion\u2009+\u2009cypermethrin, were able to control the olive bark beetle.

Distribution boundaries at these localities recur in many other taxa and coincide spatially with important fault zones. General aspects of distribution and evolution in Simplicia are addressed, using a set of critical questions posed by McGlone (2015) as a conceptual framework. The biogeographic evidence suggests that the divergence of Simplicia and of its species took place by vicariance, and that this was mediated by tectonics. All individual plants of Simplicia have dispersed to their present locality, but there is no evidence that chance dispersal with founder speciation has occurred in the genus. Trends in these grasses, such as spikelet reduction, are global and have evolved in many different environments over tens of millions of years.

During 1998 and 1999, salmon increased in size substantially faster in the seasonally inundated agricultural floodplain than in the river, suggesting better growth rates. Similarly, coded-wire-tagged juveniles released in the floodplain were significantly larger at recapture and had higher apparent growth rates than those concurrently released in the river. Improved growth rates in the floodplain were in part a result of significantly higher prey consumption, reflecting greater availability of drift invertebrates. Bioenergetic modeling suggested that feeding success was greater in the floodplain than in the river, despite increased metabolic costs of rearing in the significantly warmer floodplain. Survival indices for coded-wire-tagged groups were somewhat higher for those released in the floodplain than for those released in the river, but the differences were not statistically significant. Growth, survival, feeding success, and prey availability were higher in 1998 than in 1999, a year in which flow was more moderate, indicating that hydrology affects the quality of floodplain rearing habitat. These findings support the predictions of the flood pulse concept and provide new insight into the importance of the floodplain for salmon. </jats:p>",

In the present study, a predictive model was developed to investigate population dynamics for white sucker (Catostomus commersoni) exposed to pulp mill effluent at a well-studied site in Jackfish Bay, Lake Superior, Canada. The model uniquely combines a Leslie population projection matrix and the logistic equation to translate changes in the fecundity and the age structure of a breeding population of white sucker exposed to pulp mill effluent to alterations in population growth rate. Application of this density-dependent population projection model requires construction of a life table for the organism of interest, a measure of carrying capacity, and an estimation of the effect of stressors on vital rates. A white sucker population existing at carrying capacity and subsequently exposed to pulp mill effluent equivalent to a documented exposure experienced during the period 1988 to 1994 in Jackfish Bay would be expected to exhibit a 34% to 51% annual decrease in recruitment during the first 5 yr of exposure and approach a population size of 71% of carrying capacity.

We also tested whether wolves selected a particular forest type for their den sites. Den and rendezvous sites were located at greater distances from villages, forest edges, and intensively used roads than random points. Locations of resting sites were not affected by these manmade structures. Wolves selected dry coniferous forests for den sites but also used other forest types. We concluded that the suitability of an area for pup raising depended mainly on the spatial distribution of forest, human settlements, and public roads, and to a lesser extent on habitat characteristics. </jats:p>",

To determine the effect of fishing on capture size of both male and female Zungaro zungaro catfish, historical records of size and spatial distribution of the species were analyzed from the Orinoco Basin in Colombian. Materials and methods. Information was collected by sampling fishing port landings in the region between 1979 and 2011. Each specimen was measured, weighed and sexed. With 5411 records, the average size at capture were compared in time and among the different ports. Size at 50% maturity was estimated by quinquennium. Results. The average commercial capture sizes of Z. zungaro ranged from 35 to 161 cm standard length, with differences between males and females. From 1979 to 2011, in Puerto Lopez, the size at sexual maturity decreased from 123.8 to 83.4 cm in females and from 93.3 to 61 in males. In the annual cycle the greater average capture size in females was from April to July and for males from May to June. Average annual length is higher in the higher parts of the Meta and Guaviare river drainages. In the last quinquennium the size at 50% maturity had fallen 10 cm in females and 5 cm in males and it is higher than the average capture size. Conclusions. Populations of Z. zungaro in the Colombian Orinoco River Basin have been affected by overfishing and selective fishing of females. RESUMEN Objetivo.

In particular, changes in species seasonal phenology can modify the structure and composition of communities, with potential consequences on their functioning and the provision of ecosystem services. In mild climate areas, aphids can be present in cereal fields throughout the winter, which allows aphid parasitoids to remain active. Using a nine-year dataset of aphid-parasitoid winter trophic webs in cereal fields of Western France, we report that the community structure and composition that prevailed before 2011 have recently shifted toward a more diversified community, with the presence of two new braconid parasitoid species (<jats:italic>Aphidius ervi</jats:italic>and<jats:italic>Aphidius avenae</jats:italic>), a few hyperparasitoid species and one aphid species (<jats:italic>Metopolophium dirhodum</jats:italic>). Increases in minimal winter temperatures and the frequency of frost events across the years partially explain observed community changes. Strong bottom-up effects from the relative abundances of aphid species also determine the relative abundance of parasitoid species each winter. Strong compartmentalization in parasitoid preference for host is reported. We suggest the recent modifications in parasitoid community composition to be linked to shifts in diapause expression (reduction or arrest of the use of winter diapause) and to host availability throughout the year. We highlight the implications for natural biological control in cereal fields. Perspectives are proposed to predict the composition of future host-parasitoid communities in the climate change context.</jats:p>",

    "text": "The population structure and effective population size of the Galapagos Cormorant (Compsohalieus [Nannopterum] harrisi), a rare seabird endemic to the Galapogos Islands, Ecuador, were investigated using standard demographic techniques and data collected over nine years (1970\u20101973, 1977, 1978, and 1989\u20101992). The study population was located around Punta Espinosa, Fernandina Island, where cormorants bred at seven traditional places scattered along 9 km of bare rocky coastline. This population, averaging 96 \u00b1 13 adults (mean \u00b1 1 SD) (47 \u00b1 8 males; 50 \u00b1 7 females), is an estimated 10% of the total number (\u2248980) distributed along 350 km of coastline around Fernandina and the western coast of Isabela Island. The Galapagos Cormorant's restricted distribution and small population size probably result from its adaptation to rich upwelling systems where food is highly reliable and abundant. This adaptation apparently is also shaping the population's general breeding ecology. The population has high potential fecundity and is probably regulated through food competition by density\u2010dependent processes which affect reproductive success and juvenile recruitment more than adult survival. Demographic analyses and direct counts along the species' entire range showed that the population is stable both in its demographic structure (e.g., sex ratio and age structure) and number. The population is characterized by a high and relatively constant annual adult survival, long life\u2010span, and a generally low and variable reproductive success and annual productivity. The serial polyandrous mating system apparently has little effect on these demographic traits. Dispersal data indicated that gene flow is extensive (\u224828 km per generation) and that the whole population is distributed in at least 10 relatively discrete demes or neighborhoods. The demographic analysis yielded an expected among\u2010deme genetic variance component (F\n              s\n              t\n              ) of 0.049 (4.9%), which implies that the population is not genetically substructured to a large degree. Thus, for analyses of the effect of genetic drift, the whole population can be considered as a single panmictic unit. However, the exceptionally small total population size, and its even smaller effective population number (N\n              e\n              \u2248650), predicts a rate of loss of neutral genetic variation (\u0394F = 1/2 N\n              e\n              ) of 0.0008 (0.08%) per generation, equivalent to 0.006% per year. The population is therefore expected to be highly homozygous (G = 0.997). These population genetic traits should be taken into account for conservation purposes. Although after a crash (e.g., in 1982) the population may rapidly recover in number and otherwise remain relatively stable, its genetically effective size barely reaches the minimum number judged to be required for long\u2010term persistence in the face of genetic and environmental stochasticity. Moreover, the recurrent human disturbance of the habitat where cormorants find their prey, mainly through alteration of the sea bottom for the capture of sea cucumbers, may severely affect the survival of this endemic species, one of the world's rarest seabirds.",

    "text": "ABSTRACT\n            It is widely recognized that high supplies of fine sediment, largely sand, can negatively impact the aquatic habitat quality of gravel\u2010bed rivers, but effects of the style of input (chronic vs. pulsed) have not been examined quantitatively. We hypothesize that a continuous (i.e. chronic) supply of sand will be more detrimental to the quality of aquatic habitat than an instantaneous sand pulse equal to the integrated volume of the chronic supply. We investigate this issue by applying a two\u2010dimensional numerical model to a 1 km long reach of prime salmonid spawning habitat in central Idaho. Results show that in both supply scenarios, sand moves through the study reach as bed load, and that both the movement and depth of sand on the streambed mirrors the hydrograph of this snowmelt\u2010dominated river. Predictions indicate greater and more persistent mortality of salmonid embryos under chronic supplies than pulse inputs, supporting our hypothesis. However, predicted mortality varies both with salmonid species and location of spawning. We found that the greatest impacts occur closer to the location of the sand input under both supply scenarios. Results also suggest that reach\u2010scale morphology may modulate the impact of sand loads, and that under conditions of high sand loading climate\u2010related increases in flow magnitude could increase embryo mortality through sand deposition, rather than streambed scour.

The latter was a direct function of increasing sound intensity. Overall, the sounds did not strongly or consistently affect the whales\u2019 dive cycles or vocalizations.

Transmission modes differ: FIV is transmitted only through biting, while FeLV transmission occurs by biting, licking, grooming, and sharing food and from mother to fetus. FeLV is also more pathogenic than FIV. We compared FIV and FeLV prevalence and risk factors within five populations of cats. FIV infection occurred almost exclusively among adult male cats fighting to acquire and maintain dominant status. Classes at risk for FeLV infection included sexually intact cats allowed to roam freely. The impact of FeLV on host population growth was greater than that of FIV but varied among populations.

Then, plants were exposed to waterlogging (6\u00a0days) and drainage (2\u00a0days). Compared to plants exposed to isolated stress, the saline waterlogging resulted in higher concentrations of H2O2, O2\u02d9\u2212, and lipid peroxidation at the whole-plant level, mainly during drainage. Furthermore, saline waterlogging increased fermentation and the concentrations of Na+ and K+ in roots and leaves both during waterlogging and drainage. NO3\u2212 supplementation led to augments in NO3\u2212 and NO levels, and stimulated nitrate reductase activity in both organs. In addition, NO3\u2212 nutrition alleviated oxidative stress and fermentation besides increasing the K+/Na+ ratio in plants exposed to saline waterlogging. In conclusion, NO3\u2212 supplementation is a useful strategy to help soybean plants overcome saline waterlogging stress.

Although the direct effects of environmental conditions are relatively well studied, the effects of environmentally mediated species interactions have garnered less attention. In this study, we examined the temperature dependency of size\u2010structured intraguild predation (IGP) between native blue crabs (<jats:italic>Callinectes sapidus</jats:italic>, the IG predator) and invasive green crabs (<jats:italic>Carcinus maenas</jats:italic>, the IG prey) to evaluate how the effect of temperature on competitive and predatory rates may influence the latitudinal distribution of these species. In outdoor mesocosm experiments, we quantified interactions between blue crabs, green crabs, and shared prey (mussels) at three temperatures reflective of those across their range, using two size classes of blue crab. At low temperatures, green crabs had a competitive advantage and IGP by blue crabs on green crabs was low. At high temperatures, size\u2010matched blue and green crabs were competitively similar, large blue crabs had a competitive advantage, and IGP on green crabs was high. We then used parameter values generated from these experiments (temperature\u2010 and size\u2010dependent attack rates and handling times) in a size\u2010structured IGP model in which we varied IGP attack rate, maturation rate of the blue crab from the non\u2010predatory to predatory size class, and resource carrying capacity at each of the three temperatures. In the model, green crabs were likely to competitively exclude blue crabs at low temperature, whereas blue crabs were likely to competitively and consumptively exclude green crabs at higher temperatures, particularly when resource productivities and rates of IGP were high. While many factors may play a role in delimiting species ranges, our results suggest that temperature\u2010dependent interactions can influence local coexistence and are worth considering when developing mechanistic species distribution models and evaluating responses to environmental change.</jats:p>",

Territories, found in altered (ditched) salt marshes, were large, all\u2014purpose activity spaces. Grouped territories, found in unaltered salt marshes, were small activity spaces from which birds made distant foraging flights. Among the factors influencing the grouped territory spatial pattern the most important were nest site, availability and lack of predation. A scarcity of nest sites in the unaltered habitat appeared to require the birds to nest close together, while such aggregation was made possible by scarcity of ground predators. The territorial pattern was thought to be influenced by low population density, low food availability, and sufficiency of nest sites. The amount of time that birds spent foraging, singing, and resting did not differ between spatial patterns, nor did the diurnal pattern of these activities. Birds on grouped territories spent more time in aggression than did birds on territories. The breeding success of birds found in the two dispersion patterns did not differ. The rate of delivery of food to the nest was also the same, although birds on territories flew twice as far to gather food for their nests. The results suggest that both spatial patterns are equally successful for the given conditions.

    "text": "<jats:p>Creation of reservoirs by regulation of the Dnieper River and small rivers caused significant changes in the conditions of existence and affected on \u00a0fish biodiversity of pondsof Prydniprovya. To the anthropogenic factors influencing the species composition of fish fauna factors of technical and fishery character can be included. Technical impact on water bodies is associated with the creation of new artificial lakes, ecosystems of which are not stable and are influenced by invasive processes. Fisheries management measures include work on the introduction of new species of fish that primarily have economic importance for the development of industrial fishing. Work on the introduction of new species have both positive and negative effects, but nevertheless new species affect natively on fish fauna. This transforms biota of reservoir and creates conditions for further spread of new species, increasing their numbers, creating new ecological relationships in the ecosystem of the pond. In the formation of the Dnieper (Zaporizhia) reservoir`s fish fauna it is traditionally defined five stages: the first stage is before building a dam to the Dnieper (until 1931) when there was a natural Dnieper rapids area, inhabited by migratory, semi-migratory and local fish; the second stage is the beginning of formation of reservoir`s fish fauna with the gradual disappearance of reophilic and dominance of limnophilic species (1931\u20131941); the third stage is the restoration of fish populations of Dnieper rapids due to destruction of dam during the Second World War (1941\u20131947); fourth stage is the secondary formation of ichtiocenosis of reservoir after recovery of dam (1947\u20131960); fifth stage is reforming of the structure of fish fauna in terms of cascade (creation of Dnieper reservoirs) and anthropogenic pressures (from 1961 to the present period). The first stage is defined by period of filling the reservoir. After the construction of Zaporozhye hydroelectric station the process of rebuilding fish fauna took place. In the early years of the reservoir existence migratory and semi-migratory fish have naturally disappeared. The species composition of fish fauna has decreased by 11 taxons. The number of reophilic species has markedly reduced and remained predominantly in the upper river part of the reservoir. The lower part of reservoir with sustained hydrological regime has been being actively assimilated by fish of limnophilic complex. The second and third stages are associated with the destruction of the dam during the Second World War and the short restoration of hydrobiological regime of Dnieper rapids, until the re-filling of the reservoir and its final transformation into a regulated pond. The flow of these two phases has not influenced significantly the structure of industrial ichtyocomplex total number of species at that time was 38 taxons. The fourth stage involves fishery exploitation of reservoir. With the aim of the purposeful impact on formation of industrial fish fauna of the Dnieper (Zaporizhia) reservoir, considering sufficient development of natural fodder the works on artificial introduction of new species were carried out in the years 1950-1960. The fifth stage of development and current state of fish fauna of reservoir is characterized by the emergence and spread of invasive species. During the period of existence of the Dnieper (Zaporizhia) reservoir ichthyofauna of the reservoir has substantially transformed. In the modern fish fauna of reservoir there are 52 species of fish which are representatives of 14 families. Compared with the period of existence of Dnieper River before its regulation the number of species remained at the same level, but the species composition and structure of fish fauna changed drastically due to the loss of some species and the emergence of other species, mostly unwanted invaders. Changing the number of species is related to several factors. Firstly, process of spread of species upstream took place after the disappearance of Dnieper Rapids and rise of mineralization. Secondly, with the deliberate introduction of fish with purpose of fishery exploitation of the reservoir, and as a consequence randomly invasion of some species that came from fish farms. Thirdly, emergence of new species is also connected with the deliberate release of fish to the open water, similarly Pumpkinseed Sunfish Lepomis gibbosus (Linnaeus, 1758) has appeared in the Dnipro (Zaporizhia) reservoir, which is well acclimatized and has broadly extended its habitat in reservoirs of Dnipropetrovsk region. Today about 31 % of fish species of Dnieper (Zaporizhia) reservoir is adventitious. The process of genesis of fish fauna of the Dnieper (Zaporizhia) reservoir is still ongoing and it is connected with the subsequent emergence of new species and rise of their numbers. Such changes in the fish fauna of reservoir can harm fisheries because the vast majority of fish aliens are competitors by food for young commercially valuable fish species.</jats:p>",

However, today, the focus of river restoration has shifted towards improving biological functionality and biodiversity. In the present study, two weirs, originally built to create a stable water level, were removed on a residual flow reach in a Norwegian regulated river as a measure to restore river connectivity and to re\u2010establish the local population of Atlantic salmon. The removal design was based on hydraulic modelling, and biological monitoring was implemented before and after the weir removal to evaluate the biological response to weir removal. The results demonstrated that salmon spawning sites were recreated in the old bed substratum and were occupied immediately the first season after weir removal, when water velocities increased to more suitable levels for spawning. Accordingly, mortality of Atlantic salmon eggs was reduced and the densities of juveniles showed a marked increase after weir removal. Conversely, pike and cyprinids in the reach were found in the samples before weir removal but not after removal, indicating that the desired shift in fish community in response to habitat alteration was obtained. Furthermore, enumeration of migrating adult salmon at a fishway upstream of the study reach showed that the migration peak, on average, was 1\u2009month earlier in the 3\u2009years after removal as compared with the 5\u2009years before removal. Finally, the use of hydraulic modelling represented a useful method for designing physical habitat adjustments and assessing their influence on fish biology. The model results also supported a rapid process in planning and execution of construction works. Copyright \u00a9 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

The reasons for individual differences in susceptibility to noise are not entirely clear, but might relate, in part, to variability in ear canal acoustics and middle ear impedance. This variability alters the sound field to eardrum SPL transformation, effectively changing the magnitude of the exposure, and potentially producing differences in hearing loss. To study these effects, a computer simulation was created from an electrical analog model of the middle ear and a network representation of the ear canal. The model predicts how variation in ear canal geometry (length and diameter) and middle ear load impedance influences the eardrum SPL, both for individuals wearing hearing protector devices (\u2018\u2018leaky\u2019\u2019 earplugs) and for the unprotected ear. The model also estimates the amount of attenuation offered by the earplug and the amount of conductive hearing loss created by changes in the middle ear.

Scars were classified as either slash or round type. Both scar types were located more frequently on the left side of the fishes and below the lateral line. Details of orientation and location on the body provided clues permitting the assignment of putative causation. Small round scars were restricted to locations with connections to the Arctic Ocean and were probably caused by the marine parasitic copepod Coregonicola or by Arctic lampreys (Lampetra japonica). Larger round scars were either the result of attacks by lampreys or by previous gill net capture. Unequal distribution and orientation on the body of slash scars indicated previous capture in gill nets or predation attempts by bears, birds, or piscivorous fishes. </jats:p>",

Cranberry and highbush blueberry differ in phenology, and adaptation to these different phenologies may result in host races or cryptic species on these two crops. We recognized the alternative hypothesis that D. oxycoccana had arrived as immature stages with cranberry vines imported from another region of North America. During spring and summer, we recorded the phenology of D. oxycoccana and the development of plant shoots from three cranberry and three highbush blueberry farms to determine whether the opportunity exists for successful movement of D. oxycoccana between the two crops.

Growing fossil evidence suggest that this hump-shaped latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG) has not been persistent through time, with similar species diversity across latitudes flattening out the LDG during past greenhouse periods. This provides a new starting point for LDG research. Most studies assume the processes shaping the LDG have acted constantly through time and seek to understand why diversity accumulated in the Holarctic at lower levels than at the equator, <jats:italic>e.g.</jats:italic> as the result of limited dispersal, or higher turnover in Holarctic regions. However, fossil investigations suggest that we need to explain when and why diversity was lost at high latitudes to generate the LDG. Unfortunately, diversity lost scenarios in the Holarctic have been repeatedly proposed but not yet clearly demonstrated. Here, we use diversification approaches for both phylogenies and fossils to study the LDG of Testudines, Crocodilia and Lepidosauria. We show the LDG of these groups has varied over time, with high latitudes serving as a source of tropical diversity but suffering disproportionate extinction during transitional periods to cold climate. We outline the \u2018asymmetric gradient of extinction and dispersal\u2019 (AGED) framework, which contextualizes previous ideas behind the LDG under a time-variable scenario. We suggest the current steep LDG may be explained by the extinction of clades adapted to warmer conditions from the new temperate regions formed in the Neogene, together with the equator-ward dispersal of organisms tracking their own climatic preferences, when tropical biomes became restricted to the equator. Conversely, high rates of speciation and pole-ward dispersals can account for the formation of an ancient flat LDG during the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene greenhouse period. Our results demonstrate that the inclusion of fossils in macroevolutionary studies allows detecting extinction events less detectable in analyses restricted to present-day data only.</jats:p>",

We examine the effectiveness of spring prescribed fire on restoration of sagebrush ecosystems by documenting burn effects on soil nutrients, herbaceous aboveground biomass, and tissue nutrient concentrations. This study was conducted in a central Nevada woodland and included control and burn treatment plots sampled before and after a prescribed fire. Six native understory plant species (Crepis acuminata, Eriogonum umbellatum, Eriogonum elatum, Poa secunda secunda, Festuca idahoensis, and Lupinus argenteus) important for native sagebrush obligate foragers were chosen to represent the understory plant community. L. argenteus is also important for system nutrient cycling and nitrogen fixation. Plants were collected from three microsites (under tree canopy, under shrub canopy, and interspace) common in transitional woodlands during peak growth the summer before a spring prescribed burn and each of two summers following the burn. Soils were collected from corresponding locations at two depth intervals (0\u20138 and 8\u201352 cm) to determine the relationships between soil and plant nutrients following fire.

Nearly two hundred years have passed since whitebait was first fished for, and the industry was much more important a hundred years ago than it is to-day.

Sprat-fishing is apparently on the decline, and the only salvation for the Thames spratters is the canning industry which is here described. Mr. Wells goes into the history of both fisheries and the methods of capture, giving details of the catches of whitebait, which mainly consists of the fry of herrings and sprats but may contain also about twenty other species of young fishes.

By analysing genetic variation at the mitochondrial and nuclear microsatellite loci for 148 individuals, we identified three populations along the Yangtze River, each one connected to a group of admixed ancestry.

Habitat degradation and distribution gaps correlated with highly asymmetric gene-flow that was inefficient in maintaining connectivity between populations. Genetic inferences of historical demography revealed that the populations in the Yangtze descended from a small number of founders colonizing the river from the sea during the last Ice Age. The colonization was followed by a rapid population split during the last millennium predating the Chinese Modern Economy Development. However, genetic diversity showed a clear footprint of population contraction over the last 50 years leaving only ~2% of the pre-collapsed size, consistent with the population collapses reported from field studies.

We examined 16 yards in the Adirondacks and explored the observation that deer have changed their movement behavior to incorporate residential communities within their wintering areas. We compared locations of deer herds in 2003 and 2004 to deer wintering areas mapped during the 1960s and 1970s. Deer were predominantly absent in 9 of 16 historical yards but were present in residential communities within the same drainage. Yarding areas to which deer shifted contained more residential, deciduous, and mixed cover than yards where no shift occurred, indicating that deer in residential areas were using conifer and mixed cover at a finer scale than deer in nonresidential areas. Smaller winter ranges and core areas of marked deer in a residential winter yard further imply greater concentration of resources available in these areas. Marked deer demonstrated flexibility in core winter range fidelity, a behavior that allows for more permanent shifts as habitat and food resources change or as new areas with appropriate resources are encountered. Our study suggests that low\u2010density residential areas in lowland conifer forests may provide an energetic advantage for deer during winter due to the assemblage of quality habitat interspersed with open areas and a variety of potential food sources in environments where movement is typically constrained by deep snow. Managers should consider the potential for changes in use of deer wintering areas prior to land conservation efforts and may need to adapt management strategies to reduce conflicts in communities occupied by deer during winter.",

This period of reduction in tree-ring width lasted longer and was greater in magnitude in the pure Scots pine stands studied within a coniferous mixed forest habitat. Furthermore, the reduction in Scots pine tree-ring width was largely dependent on below-average air temperature in the period from December of the year preceding ring formation until January of the current year and above-average total precipitation from June until August above-average SO2, NH3 and NOx emissions and above-average surface and underground water withdrawals from company intakes. The influence of weather on VTRW was weakened by anthropogenic factors, which affected the quality of the local natural environment.

Using alternative hypotheses about stock\u0096recruitment dynamics and environmental variation is important because using only a single hypothesis can lead to substantially different reference points and policy implications. The alternative hypotheses are augmented with prior information collected from meta-analyses of stock\u0096recruitment data to construct a set of age-structured production models. We illustrate our approach using three overfished New England groundfish stocks. We fit alternative model likelihoods to observed data using Bayesian inference techniques. The Schwarz goodness-of-fit criterion was used to calculate model probabilities. Bayesian model averaging was used to estimate rebuilding targets that were robust to model selection uncertainty. Model-averaged estimates suggested that rebuilding targets for overfished stocks can be reasonably well determined if adequate prior information on stock productivity is available.

Wax plugs blocked the penetration of fungal hyphae into stomata of A. robusta in 100% of encounters. In contrast, hyphae readily penetrated stomata of leaves from which wax plugs had been removed or where the wax plugs were damaged. On rare occasions, hyphae were also observed to penetrate directly through the cuticle. Florin rings around the external surface of stomata also acted to deflect fungal hyphae from the stomatal opening. Formation and degradation of wax plugs was also examined to assess the period over which they offer protection from fungal invasion. Wax plugs formed in young leaves in spring and were complete by summer. There was subsequent degradation of wax plugs in the following winter, and they then regenerated again in spring. However, regeneration of wax plugs appeared to decline after the leaves reached 2 years of age. The data are discussed with reference to the adaptive significance of wax plugs in conifers and other plants.\n</jats:p>",

The underlying causes of recovery remain unclear, but resistance to RHDV infection has been reported in laboratory studies of wild-caught rabbits. Aims We document numerical changes in two South Australian wild rabbit populations that were initially suppressed by RHDV, and examine serological data to evaluate several alternative hypotheses for the cause of recovery. Methods Rabbit numbers were assessed from spotlight transect counts and dung mass transects between 1991 and 2011, and age and RHDV antibody sero-prevalence were estimated from rabbits shot in late summer. Key results Rabbit numbers were heavily suppressed by RHDV between 1995 and 2002, then increased 5- to 10-fold between 2003 and 2010. During the period of increase, annual RHDV infection rates remained stable or increased slightly, average age of rabbits remained stable and annual rainfall was below average. Conclusions Rabbit populations recovered but neither avoidance of RHDV infection, gradual accumulation of long-lived RHD-immune rabbits, nor high pasture productivity were contributing factors. This leaves increased annual survival from RHDV infection as the most likely cause of recovery. Implications Previously documented evidence of resistance to RHDV infection may be of little consequence to post-RHD recovery in rabbit numbers, unless the factors that influence the probability of infection also shape the course of infection and affect survival of infected rabbits.</jats:p>",

However, pasture production declines over time in cleared pastures until a new equilibrium is reached. The present study focussed on elucidating the reasons for decline in pasture production and finding the key soil properties that are affected due to clearing. Paired sites for cleared and uncleared pastures were selected to represent 3 dominant tree communities of the semi-arid tropics in central Queensland, i.e. Eucalyptus populnea, E. melanophloia, and Acacia harpophylla. The cleared pastures were chosen to represent 3 different durations of time since clearing (5, 11\u201313, and 33 years) to evaluate the temporal impact of clearing on soil properties. Various soil parameters were studied: macronutrients\u2014available N (NH4+and NO3\u2013), total N, and available P; micronutrients\u2014Cu, Fe, Zn, and Mn; exchangeable cations\u2014Ca, Mg, Na, and K (also macronutrients); pHw; and electrical conductivity. Of these, pHw showed a significant response to time of clearing for all 3 tree communities. Soil pHw increased significantly at cleared sites relative to uncleared (native woodland) pastures, and the increase was highly correlated with concentrations of exchangeable Ca, Mg, and Na. The change in soil pHw and exchangeable cations was more evident at &gt;0.30 m soil depth. The increase in soil pHw in cleared pastures decreased the availability of soil nutrients for plant growth and, hence, pasture productivity. The interactions of different soil properties down the profile as a result of changes caused by clearing are important when interpreting the effects of clearing on soil properties.\n</jats:p>",

Long-term records from 5 Irish rivers were used to explore relationships between annual sea trout runs and estimated total number of lice on nearby salmon farms. It was hypothesised that local environmental conditions may result in system-specific differences in realised louse pressure on sea trout. Louse count was thus tested as an absolute number and as a relative pressure, i.e. standardised by farm. When the standardised total number of mobile lice on a given salmon farm in April was above baseline level (50<jats:sup>th</jats:sup> percentile of observed annual values on that farm), there was a high probability of a below-average sea trout run in the local river. Absolute louse counts did not show an important effect on runs. This finding suggests that salmon farm louse production in spring can have a strong system-specific regulating effect on wild sea trout populations. Total number of lice on a farm was most strongly driven by changes in individual infestation rate, with a lesser effect of stocking density. Thresholds for number of mobile lice per farmed salmon required to maintain total louse count below the baseline varied with stocking density and among systems: greater density required lower infestation rate.

Removal of the environmental component of recruitment variability revealed dome-shaped stock\u2013recruit curves with sharply ascending left limbs and relatively high degrees of compensatory density dependence in recruitment as measured by the Ricker parameter, \u03b2. The degree of such density dependence was positively correlated with recruitment variability which was itself negatively associated with mean stock size, i.e. large herring stocks tended to have less recruitment variability but lower levels of density dependence in recruitment than smaller stocks. In addition, environmental variability was positively associated with recruitment variability, and for stocks of the same size, the more northern populations of spring-spawning herring, inhabiting a more variable environment, have a higher level of density dependence on recruitment. Simulation studies showed that larger herring stocks could sustain higher levels of fishing mortality than smaller herring stocks, due mainly to reduced recruitment variability. We suggest that the most appropriate fishing strategy for herring is to maintain fishing mortality at a level of F\u2002=\u20020.20 with the option of closure when parent stock size falls below the critical level. A surprising finding from our study was the high level of density dependence of recruitment in herring stocks which we attributed to several features: (1) a large egg size and the ability of herring populations to adapt to a wide range of spawning conditions, (2) a density-dependent mortality associated with egg hatching success, and (3) a strong homing tendency ensuring that changes in spawning population sizes are spread evenly throughout the spawning area, thereby optimizing larval production. </jats:p>",

We investigate factors influencing activity indices of a top predator (dingo) and an introduced mesopredator (red fox) in forests of south-eastern Australia. We used generalised linear models to investigate the effects that net primary productivity, proximity to freehold land and poison baiting campaigns directed at dingoes had on fox and dingo activity. Baiting was the best predictor of activity for both dingoes and foxes. Dingo activity was variable but typically lower at baited sites. Fox activity varied within a lower range at a majority of sites compared to the dingo but was typically higher at the baited sites. Positive responses of foxes to dingo control are consistent with the mesopredator release hypothesis and suggest in this region dingoes may have greater suppressive effect on fox populations than poisoning campaigns directed towards dingoes. Our results suggest that removal of dingoes may be counter-productive for biodiversity conservation because it may lead to higher activity of foxes.",

Yields per unit area greatly increased because of better rearing methods, polyculture, integrated farm - fish pond culture, introductions of new strains and species, and intensification of culture techniques.

Many of these creations lie within habitat conservation plan (HCP) sites, and they could play a more prominent role by being repositories for plants taken from a single site having site-specific genetics. Among others, one technique that increases initial resemblance to natural stands uses digitized, to-scale photography, which has been ground-truthed to verify vascular plant associations, which appear as mosaics on a landscape. A combination of placing patches of salvaged, mature canopy plants within larger matrices of imprinted or container plant plots appears to significantly enhance immediate use by CSS obligate bird species, accelerate \u201cspread\u201d or expansion of CSS, and can also introduce many epiphytic taxa that otherwise would be slow or unable to occupy developing CSS creations. Reptile, amphibian, butterfly, and rodent diversity in a salvaged canopy restoration case study at the University of California, Irvine, showed CSS species foraging and inhabiting transplanted canopy patches. Using restoration techniques to expand existing CSS stands has more promise than creating isolated patches, and the creation of canopies resembling CSS mid-fire cycle stands is now common. Gnatcatchers and other birds use restorations for foraging and occasional nesting, and in some cases created stands along \u201cbiological corridors\u201d appear to be useful to bird movement. Patches of transplanted sage scrub shrubs along habitat edges appear to break up linear edge effects.

Long-term planning including burning is needed so that a fire-adapted habitat will develop.

To study a possible role for VirE3 in transcriptional regulation, we stably expressed virE3 in A. thaliana under control of a tamoxifen-inducible promoter. By RNA sequencing we showed that upon expression of virE3 the RNA levels of 607 genes were increased more than three-fold and those of 132 genes decreased more than three-fold. One of the strongly activated genes was that encoding VBF (At1G56250), an F-box protein that may affect the levels of the VirE2 and VIP1 proteins. Using Arabidopsis cell suspension protoplasts we showed that VirE3 stimulates the VBF promoter, especially when co-expressed with pBrp. Although pBrp is localized at the external surface of plastids, co-expression of VirE3 and pBrp in Arabidopsis cell suspension protoplasts resulted in the accumulation of pBrp in the nucleus. Our results suggest that VirE3 affects the transcriptional machinery of the host cell to favour the transformation process.",

    "text": "A warming climate coupled with reductions in water availability and rising salinity are increasingly affecting rice (Oryza sativa) yields. Elevated temperatures combined with vapour pressure deficit (VPD) rises are causing stomatal closure, further reducing plant productivity and cooling. It is unclear what stomatal size (SS) and stomatal density (SD) will best suit all these environmental extremes. To understand how stomatal differences contribute to rice abiotic stress resilience, we screened the stomatal characteristics of 72 traditionally bred varieties. We found significant variation in SS, SD and calculated anatomical maximal stomatal conductance (gsmax) but did not identify any varieties with SD and gsmax as low as transgenic OsEPF1oe plants. Traditionally bred varieties with high SD and small SS (resulting in higher gsmax) typically had lower biomasses, and these plants were more resilient to drought than low SD and large SS plants, which were physically larger. None of the varieties assessed were as resilient to drought or salinity as low SD OsEPF1oe transgenic plants. High SD and small SS rice displayed faster stomatal closure during increasing temperature and VPD, but photosynthesis and plant cooling were reduced. Compromises will be required when choosing rice SS and SD to tackle multiple future environmental stresses.",

As part of long-term monitoring of Laguna Larga, we were able to follow the lagoon's water quality from 2015 to 2018 and could assess the impacts of Hurricane Irma (September 8\u20139, 2017) by intensifying our sampling frequency. Physicochemical parameters (salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen, dissolved inorganic nitrogen, dissolved reactive silicate and total nitrogen) exhibited significant variations associated with Hurricane Irma. Salinity decreased due to the extraordinary rainfall of the hurricane (339.8 mm/24 h, a new record for Cayo Coco). The water level in the lagoon rose 0.85 m. Strong hurricane winds and intense runoff drove organic matter and sediment resuspension. Anoxia and an increase of nutrients occurred throughout the lagoon. The main biogeochemical impact was that it boosted these eutrophic conditions of the lagoon, to levels that lasted for several months. A significant correlation among nutrients, salinity and dissolved oxygen was found. After 6 months, water quality in the lagoon had recovered to conditions similar to those before the hurricane. The case of Laguna Larga shows that those coastal systems under anthropic pressure can take longer to recover after extreme climatic events, and highlights the need for long-term monitoring of tropical coastal ecosystems.</jats:p>",

    "text": "Full-annual-cycle (FAC) models integrate seasonal demographic and environmental processes to elucidate the factors that limit and regulate animal populations. Unlike traditional, breeding-season-focused models of migratory populations, FAC population models include the effects on population dynamics of events in both the breeding and the nonbreeding season (i.e. winter and migration). Given that migratory birds can spend most of the year away from the breeding grounds and face seasonally specific threats and limitation, FAC models can provide critical and unique insights about their population dynamics. We review existing FAC population model types, including demographic network models, seasonal matrix models, and individual-based models, with examples of each type. We also suggest some approaches new to FAC population modeling\u2014integrated population models and integral projection models\u2014and make recommendations for the development and implementation of these models. Incorporating model components such as density dependence, migratory connectivity (the demographic linkages between breeding and nonbreeding areas), and seasonal interactions can be critical for model realism but can also increase model complexity and development time. Much of the development of FAC population models has been more theoretical than applied. The main limitation to the application of the developed models is availability of empirical data for all annual stages, particularly knowledge of migratory connectivity and density-dependent seasonal survival. As these data become more available, the models outlined here should find additional uses.",

    "text": "Lake Victoria is the second-largest freshwater lake in the world, and fish from the lake are a vital food resource for millions of people living around it. The silver cyprinid (Rastrineobola argentea), a small schooling pelagic species known in Tanzania as \u201cdagaa\u201d contributes ca. 55% to the total annual catch (ca. 0.51 million tonnes (MT) in 2014). The acoustic target strength (TS, dB re 1\u2009m2) of dagaa, a key factor for biomass estimation, is however not well described, and is a major source of uncertainty in biomass estimation. In this study, we developed a Kirchhoff-ray mode (KRM) model to predict the TS of dagaa at standard fisheries survey frequencies. The model was based on the morphology of the body and the dual-chambered swimbladder, as obtained from X-ray images of fish ranging in total length (TL) between 2.8 and 5.4\u2009cm. The results suggested that the swimbladder (which comprises 2.6 to 8.2% of body volume) accounts for ca. 65 to 90% of the total backscattering at 120\u2009kHz. The predicted TS was highly dependent on tilt angle, varying by 14.0\u2009dB at 120\u2009kHz across the tilt range 65\u2013115\u02da (where 0\u02da is head up and 180\u02da is tail up), and TS variability with tilt generally increased with increasing frequency. The tilt angle of acoustically tracked individual fish indicated a distribution of tilt angles with a mean and s.d. of 93.5 and 15.1\u00b0. Our model suggested a new tilt-averaged TS\u2013TL relationship for dagaa [$T{S}_{120\\ kHz} = 19.49\\log ( {TL} ) - 70.3$], which leads to a TS 1.5\u2009dB higher than the value in the relationship presently used to estimate stock biomass. The new relationship will lead to a substantial reduction (by ca. 30%) in estimated biomass. The discrepancies between the mean relative frequency response of the in situ measurements of backscatter from dagaa and the KRM model predictions were in the range of -2.9\u20133.1\u2009dB at frequencies from 45 to 250\u2009kHz. The KRM modelling and in situ broadband measurements of dagaa will be beneficial for acoustic identification and behavioural studies of dagaa, and will enable improved biomass assessment, thereby underpinning sustainable long-term management.",
